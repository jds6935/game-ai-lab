This box contains everything you need to play the DUNGEONS & DRAGoNS® Adventure 
Game. Read this sheet before you go on to the other components. 


What is the D&D® Game? 

This fantasy adventure game provides the basic rules so that you and your friends 
can participate in interactive stories. Players take on the roles of mighty heroes— 
fighters, thieves, wizards, and priests—and use imagination, the game rules, and dice 
to determine the outcome of epic quests and dangerous adventures. One player takes 
on the special role of Dungeon Master (or DM), who controls the pace of the story 
and referees the action along the way. 


What's In This Box? 

Rules Book: Everyone should read up to page 13 of this book to learn how to play 
the game. The rest of the book contains information that’s just for the Dungeon 
Master, such as how to be a good DM, creating random dungeons, and a selection 
of monsters that inhabit the D&D world. 

Adventures Book: This book contains details on the town of Haven and presents 
three ready-to-play scenarios. This book should only be read by the DM. 

Hero Folders: There are eight Hero Folders, each containing a different character. Each 
player may read these and select a hero to play. 

DM Screen: This screen features the town of Haven on one side and important charts 
and notes for the Dungeon Master’s use during a game session on the other. 

Adventure Dice: The dice used in the game. There are six dice of different shapes, 
each with a different number of sides—4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20. 


What Should You Do First? 

e Step One: Select a Dungeon Master. This can be the owner of the game or whoever 
is most interested in taking on this important role. If parents are playing with their 
kids, this is a great role for mom or dad. 

e Step Two: The DM must read the Rules Book and the first adventure in the 
Adventures Book before the first game session begins. 

e Step Three: Gather a group of friends or family. The game can be played by two to 
nine players, but it works best with a DM and three to five other players. 

e Step Four: Let the players select characters from among the Hero Folders. 

e Step Five: Start playing! You can learn the game rules as you go along, or you can 
let everyone read through pages 1-13 of the Rules Book. The first adventure, “Mystery 
of UnderTown,” starts right in the middle of the action and is a great place to begin!

2 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


RRR RD, 


What is D&D? 


Imagine an ancient place in an ancient time; 
a world much like ours was, long ago, when 
armored knights carried gleaming swords, 
stone castles rose from wooded hills, and 
thatched cottages dotted the land. 

Imagine that in this place, fabled beasts 
and monsters of all descriptions exist, 
prowling the dark forests and haunting the 
deepest dungeons. 

Imagine that magic really works, that 
faerie folk such as elves, dwarves, and 
halflings live side by side with humans, and 
that modern conveniences have not even 
been dreamed of—let alone invented—in 
this long-ago place. 

The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game lets you 
explore this imaginary world of epic quests. 
All you need is this game, a couple of will- 
ing friends, and your imagination. 

The game requires a minimum of two 
players or as many as nine players, but it 
works best with a group of five. Each player 
pretends to be an adventurer, an imaginary 
character who lives in this medieval fantasy 
world and gets by with a sharp sword or a 
handy magical spell. 

With the D&D game, you get to partici- 
pate in the ultimate interactive story—a 
story where you get to determine what hap- 
pens next by the actions your adventurer 
takes. These stories, called adventures, can 
be dramatic, funny, scary, mysterious, 
action-packed, or any combination of these 
elements. How do the adventures end? 
That’s the best part of a D&D game; the 
ending isn’t determined until the adventur- 
ers (your characters) get there! 


The Players 

Imagine this long-ago time once more and pic- 
ture yourself as a poor but ready hero, eager 
to strike out on your first exciting quest. You 
will encounter other adventurers like yourself, 
and together you will explore the unknown 


land beyond the village where you grew up. 
You will fight monsters, discover hidden treas- 
ures, and grow more powerful, famous, and 
rich with every quest you complete! 

The players play the roles of mighty adven- 
turers, heroic characters who inhabit the 
ancient time of epic fantasy. These heroes 
include stalwart fighters, brave priests, cun- 
ning thieves, and powerful wizards. It’s kind 
of like acting, except everything happens 
around the gaming table. You don’t have to 
stand up and deliver lines or perform stunts; 
you just have to find a comfortable seat wher- 
ever you're playing, explain what your charac- 
ter is doing, and roll some dice. The scene 
plays out in your imagination and in the 
imaginations of the other players. 

One player gets a special role in the game. 
This player, called the Dungeon Master (or 


DM), controls the pace of the story and refer- 
ees the action along the way. The DM is vital 
to every D&D game and someone must agree 
to be the DM for every game session. 


Read the next section to learn how to play 
the D&D game. After that, players should 
select characters from the Hero Folders. 
The rest of this book (starting with the 


section entitled “For the DM Only”) and 
the Adventures Book should only be read 
by the player who’s going to be the DM. 


Playing the Game 

In the D&D game, the Dungeon Master and 
the other players get together to create a 
story. The DM begins an adventure with one 
of the scenarios presented in the Adventures 


\\ 


N 4 D ap an 
Ñ 
AYI a 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS? Rules Book 


Book or with one of his or her own devising. 
The scenario provides a basic plot for the 
adventure; how the story develops depends 
on what the players have their characters do. 

The other players each take one of the 
Hero Folders. These contain ready-to-play 
characters, complete with game statistics; 
weapons, armor, and other equipment; and 
other pertinent data about each character. 

An adventure scenario contains a back- 
ground for the adventure, a map of the “dun- 
geon” in which the adventure takes place, 
and bits of text the DM reads out loud that 
either sets the mood or describes what the 
heroes see in a specific location. 

After the DM presents the read-aloud text, 
the players can ask questions and tell the 
DM what they want their characters to do. 
It’s the DM’s job to tell the players what 
their characters see and hear, explaining 
what happens after each character performs 
an action. Here’s an example: 


DM: You see a dagger jutting from the 
pile of trash in the corner. 

Player: I pick up the dagger. 

DM: Its hilt is intricately carved in the 
shape of a dragon’s head. The handle is 
warm to the touch, and the jeweled eyes 


glow. 
Player: Hmm, that doesn’t sound too 
good. I drop it back into the trash pile. 
DM: You try, but the dagger refuses to 
leave your hand... . 


Winning 
The D&D game isn’t like any other game 
you've ever played. You don’t win by beat- 
ing the other players. Instead, there are a lot 
of different ways to “win the game.” 

The first way to win is to help the entire 
group tell a fun and exciting story. You can 
either successfully complete the adventure 


4 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


or you can fail miserably, but if everyone 
has a good time and you create a story that 
everyone is going to remember, then the 
group wins. 

Each adventure has a different “victory 
condition.” Sometimes “winning” is just the 
heroes escaping from the dungeon in one 
piece. Other times, the adventure may call 
for a specific goal to be accomplished or a 
specific monster to be defeated. 

Individual players win when their charac- 
ters defeat monsters and villains, gain treas- 
ure and experience points, and increase their 
personal power and reputation. It’s also sat- 
isfying to create a personality for your char- 
acter that grows and develops over time. 

That’s the other cool thing about the D&D 
game—each adventure is just one tale in the 
continuing saga of your hero characters. 
Sure, you can play once and have a great 
time, but the real excitement comes from 
watching your character improve and get 
better from one adventure to the next. For 
example, if your wizard finds a scroll full of 
spells in one adventure, she can keep it and 
use it in the next adventure! 


The Dice 


There are six dice in this box. Each die is a dif- 
ferent shape and has a different number of 
sides. 

These dice help determine the outcome of 
actions in the game. If a player wants his or 
her character to try something (attack a 
monster, disarm a trap, break open a locked 
door, etc.), the dice are used whenever the 
action isn’t a sure thing. 

The dice used in the D&D game are 
described below. How to use them will be 
explained shortly. 


d4: A die with four sides, numbered 
from 1 to 4. 

d6: A die with six sides, numbered 
from 1 to 6. 

d8: A die with eight sides, numbered 
from 1 to 8. 


d10: A die with ten sides, numbered 
from 1 to 10. 

d12: A die with twelve sides, numbered 
from 1 to 12. 

d20: A die with twenty sides, num- 
bered from 1 to 20. 


The Hero Folders 


Each player selects one of the Hero Folders. Each 
Hero Folder details one D&D character. Here’s 
what you'll find on each four-page folder: 

Name: The hero’s name. 

Player: Write your name here so everyone 
knows who’s running this character. 

Class: All D&D characters belong to a 
general class. The class helps define a char- 
acter, providing advantages that characters 
of other classes don’t have. 

e Fighters are warriors, trained to use their 
great size and strength to best advantage. 
Fighters generally use swords, shields, 
and metal armor. They believe in hacking 
and slashing their way to fame and for- 
tune. 

¢ Paladins are a special kind of fighter. 
They are holy warriors dedicated to a spe- 
cific cause or faith. Their unyielding belief 
gives them limited healing powers and 
some resistance to evil creatures. 

e Priests are dedicated to a holy mission, 
using spells to heal and weapons to 
defend the weak. They travel the land, 
proclaiming their faith with every quest 
they accept and every monster that they 
banish. 

e Thieves are fast of foot, nimble of fingers, 
and sneaky like you would not believe. 


They aid an adventuring party by finding 
traps, picking locks, and doing stealthy 
things. Thieves rarely steal from their 
companions, but they have been known to 
swipe valuables from the evil rich of that 
long-ago time. 

e Wizards are highly intelligent but physi- 
cally unimposing. Long years of magical 
study have left them unable to use most 
weapons but have made them powerful 
spellcasters. Magical spells are their tools 
and trade, their weapons and defenses. 


Race: In the D&D game, characters belong 
to different races. Most characters in our 
imaginary world are humans, but there are 
also dwarves, elves, and halflings roaming 
the land. 
¢ Humans look just like us and come in all 

the regular sizes and colors. 

e Dwarves are usually short and stocky, 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 5 


ZZL LL LL LLL A ROR REO RRE 


born to underground settings and fond of 
gold and gems. They tend to be serious, 
hard working, and somewhat gruff. Strong 
of body and good with tools, dwarf heroes 
gravitate toward careers as fighters. 
¢ Elves are slightly shorter and slimmer 
than humans, born to forests and pos- 
sessed of a great love for nature. They 
tend to be creative, expressing their artistic 
impulses through song, dance, poetry, or a 
musical instrument. Considered frivolous 
and aloof, they find magic and swordplay 
fascinating; elf heroes tend to combine 
fighters and wizards into a less powerful 
but more versatile expression of the two. 
Halflings are shorter and less stocky than 
dwarves, born to valley and meadow vil- 
lages. Generally open and outgoing but 
possessed of great curiosity, halflings are 
brave and cunning. They enjoy good liv- 
ing, rough humor, and interesting conver- 
sation. When the adventuring mood falls 
upon halfling heroes, they often call upon 
the thieving skills to aid them. 


Level: This is a measure of how experi- 
enced a character is. Because heroes in a 
D&D game can be used in multiple adven- 
tures (kind of like a saved computer game or 
characters in a movie sequel), they can get 
better over time. The higher the level, the 
more experienced and powerful a hero is. 


Ability Scores: These numbers form the 
base of a character’s description. They can 
range from 3 to 18, and just like real life, 
characters will be better in some things and 
less so in others. There are six abilities: 

e Strength shows how physically strong a 
character is. 

e Dexterity shows a character’s physical 
quickness. 

e Constitution is a character’s physical 
toughness and endurance. 

e Intelligence determines how smart a char- 
acter is. 


6 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


e Wisdom is a measure of a character’s com- 
mon sense. 

e Charisma shows how appealing a character 
is. 


Fighters have high Strength and 
Constitution scores, priests have high 
Wisdom scores, thieves have high Dexterity 
scores, and wizards have high Intelligence 
scores. 

Armor: The protective gear a character 
possesses. 

Armor Class: A rating of how hard it is to 
successfully attack a character. Lower is better. 

Move: This number shows how fast a 
character can move. 

Hit Points: These measure the amount of 
damage a character can withstand before 
dying. 

Wounds: Record hit points lost to damage 
here. When a character’s wounds exceed his 
or her hit point total, the character dies and 
is out of the game. 

Gold: In the long-ago land portrayed in 
the D&D game, gold pieces are used as 
money. Record any gold your character 
earns here. 

XP: Record any eXperience Points your 
character earns here, adding it to the num- 
ber shown for his or her starting level. When 
the total equals or exceeds the next level 
number, your character achieves a new 
experience level. 

Weapons: This shows the types of 
weapons each character owns and how 
much damage each weapon can inflict on a 
successful attack. The damage rating is 
shown as a type of die—1d8 or 1d6, for 
example. 

Special Abilities: Characters have differ- 
ent abilities depending on their class, race, or 
ability scores. These are covered here. 

Equipment: This lists the important items 
a character possesses. Ordinary things like 
cloaks and boots aren’t mentioned, but 


useful items such as ropes and torches are. 

Spells: Some characters have either magi- 
cal or priestly spells that they can call upon. 
These are listed here. 

Saving Throw: A special die roll that is 
used when a character must resist some- 
thing, like the effects of a spell or poison. 

THAC%: A rating of a character’s chance 
of hitting a foe in combat. 


The fantasy world and characters we’re 
talking about here are imaginary. As such, 
we make a big distinction between players 
and characters. They are not the same! You 
are a player. You describe the actions of an 
imaginary character. This is important for 
many reasons. In game play, for example, 
you may know things your character does 
not—and vice versa! Keep the two sepa- 
rate for maximum fun and game clarity. 


Game Rules 


There really aren’t a lot of rules involved in 
the D&D game. It all comes down to how 
characters move, fight, perform actions, cast 
spells, and gain experience. For everything 
else, we have a Dungeon Master. If something 
comes up that isn’t specifically covered by 
these rules, the DM decides what to do. 


Using the Dice 
Whenever a character wants to do something 
important, the DM calls for a die roll. 
Important activities include fighting or per- 
forming game-related activities. The DM 
won't make you roll dice if your character 
wants to walk across a room, but if your 
character tries something that isn’t a sure 
thing (attacking a monster, picking a lock, 
etc.), the dice are used to add that element of 
suspense and excitement the game requires. 
Most actions in the game require the roll 
of the twenty-sided die (d20). The other dice 


are used to determine damage and for a few 
select actions, as described later. 

The short way to refer to the dice is d4, 
d6, etc. If you have to roll more than one die 
of a particular type, you'll see a number in 
front of the notation, like this: 2d4. This one 
means you need to roll two four-sided dice 
and add the results together. 

You will also see this kind of notation: 
2d4+3. This means you roll two four-sided 
dice, add them together, then add an addi- 
tional three points to get the result. Weapon 
or monster attack damage might look like 
this, for example. 


Time in the Game 

Time is very flexible and should be used to 
help advance the story. The DM can move 
time along as he or she sees fit to get on to 
the “good parts” of the story. “Three days 
pass as you travel along the road... .” for 
example, or “Six hours after nightfall, your 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 7 


camp is attacked by howling beasts. . . .” are 
ways the DM might do this. 

In combat situations, time is measured in 
rounds. A character can do one thing in a 
round—attack a monster, cast a spell, pick a 
lock, etc. The DM can decide if a simple 
action takes one round (drinking a potion) 
or several rounds (searching a dead body), 
depending on the situation. 


Moving 
We measure how far a character can move by 
his or her move number. Each point of move- 
ment indicates that the character can walk 10 
feet in a cautious manner in a single round. 
So, a hero with a movement rate of 12 can 
walk up to 120 feet in a round. Characters 
can also move up to half their total move- 
ment and attack once in the same round. 
Running doubles movement totals, but a 
running character can’t do anything else in 
that round. When running in an unexplored 
dungeon, a hero might miss spotting traps 
or wind up lost just to gain a little speed. 
This could be very bad for the hero. .. . 


Fighting 

Sooner or later, your characters will be con- 
fronted by a monster that refuses to negoti- 
ate or flee. When this happens, it’s time for 
your characters to draw their weapons and 
take the battle right to the monsters! When 
characters attack, the players roll dice to 
see when and if they hurt the monsters. 
When the monsters (or other characters not 
controlled by the players) strike back, the 
DM rolls. 

The DM controls the actions of the mon- 
sters. The DM can decide to have monsters 
gang up on one character, or fight them all 
separately. The DM decides when the mon- 
sters flee from the battle—or stay to fight 
until the bitter end! 

Remember, the point of the game is to 
have fun. The DM isn’t the players’ 


8 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


opponent. It’s not the DM’s job to try to kill 
the characters. The DM’s job is to fairly 
determine the consequences of the charac- 
ters’ actions and use common sense to 
make the monsters behave in reasonable 
ways. 

How does combat work? Well, let’s imag- 
ine that our adventuring party is moving 
cautiously down a dark dungeon corridor. 
Suddenly, three small humanoids with red 
skin and yellow eyes burst into the small 
ring of light thrown by the torch one of the 
heroes carries. 

Who Goes First? Each side rolls a d10. 
One player rolls for the adventurers, and the 
DM rolls for the monsters. The side with the 
lower roll goes first. This side has the initia- 
tive over the other. If the rolls are tied, roll 
again. 

Then What? Okay, we know who has ini- 
tiative. Now the side with initiative takes its 


actions. Let’s assume that the heroes are going 
first. The DM goes around the table and, in 
turn, asks each player what his or her charac- 
ter is going to do. If a character is doing any- 
thing other than casting a spell, resolve the 
action immediately. If a character is casting a 
spell, have the player say which spell and 
then wait until the end of the round. 

(If the heroes were expecting trouble, they 
probably already have weapons in hand. If 
not, they have to spend their first round 
drawing a weapon.) 

After all attacks and actions for the side 
are resolved, spellcasting is resolved. (See 
below.) 

Then the DM gets to make an attack roll 
or perform an action for each of the mon- 
sters still in the fight. 


Here’s how to make an attack roll. Each 
character has an attack number, listed as 
the THACO (the number needed To Hit 
Armor Class 0). Roll a d20. Subtract the 
die roll from the character’s THACO 
number. If the result is less than or equal 
to the target’s Armor Class, the attack 
hits. 

Example: Elanna’s player rolls a 15 on 
the d20. Her THACO is 19. 19-15 = 4. 
Elanna hits any target that has an AC of 4 
or higher (4, 5, 6, 7, etc.). 

What if Elanna’s player had rolled a 
20? 19-20 = -1! That’s a great roll! It 
means that Elanna would hit a monster 
with an Armor Class as good as -1. 

If the attack is successful, roll for dam- 
age (every weapon and monster has a 
damage code, usually expressed as 1d8, 
or 2d4, etc.). Write the total in the wounds 
space on the Hero Folder or on scrap 
paper for the monster. When the wounds 
total exceeds the number of hit points the 
hero or monster has, it dies. 


If the monsters had won the initiative, 
they'd attack first. Any spellcasters in the 
adventuring party that are successfully 
attacked can’t cast spells that round. Instead, 
they should try to get away from the monsters 
or use weapons to attack the monsters directly. 


What Else Can A Character or Monster 
Do? Quite a bit. During a round, a character 
or monster can move normally, move half 
the normal distance and attack, try to run 
away (at twice the normal move), bind the 
wounds of a companion, change weapons, 
pick up or drop an item, use a special ability, 
drink a potion, or just stand around and 
watch the battle. 

Magic Happens Last. After all other 
actions on a side have been resolved, go back 
and determine the effects of any spells that 
side cast. Why do spells occur after all other 
actions? Because it takes time to perform the 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 9 


complicated gestures and say the enchanted 
words necessary to cast a spell. Note that 
during a round in which a spellcaster loses 
initiative (goes after the other side), he or she 
cannot cast a spell if successfully attacked 
that round, because the damage inflicted on 
the wizard disrupts his or her concentration. 

Go On To The Next Round. That's the end 
of the first round of combat. If there are still 
characters or monsters left on both sides who 
want to fight, the combat continues. Repeat 
these steps every round until one side is 
defeated, runs away, or surrenders. 

Death. Characters and monsters in the 
D&D game die. The potential for a hero to die 
lends the game drama and a sense of danger 
for the players’ characters. A dead character 
can mean the end of an adventure, but it’s not 
the end of the game! Just grab a different 
Hero Folder or change the name of your 
departed character and you can start over 
with this new hero. (You might have to wait 
until the other adventurers get back to town 
for the character to logically join them, but 
otherwise it’s as easy as that.) 

When a monster drops to 0 hit points or 
below (its wounds equal or exceed its hit 
point total), it has been killed. For a charac- 
ter, however, dropping to 0 hit points or 
below means he is unconscious. Every round 
thereafter, that character loses 1 hit point and 
is in danger of dying until another character 
performs an action to bind his wounds. 
Binding the wounds stems the dying condi- 
tion—the character remains unconscious but 
returns to and remains at 0 hit points until 
healed by magic or through rest. 

If a hero drops 10 points below 0 (to -10 hit 
points), the character is well and truly dead. 
Some powerful magic might still change his 
fate, but otherwise say farewell to our valiant 
hero and select a new character. 


10 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


Common rules of thumb for D&D combat 

include: 

e No more than two characters can stand 
and fight side by side in a typical 10- 
foot-wide corridor. 

e No more than two characters can attack 


the same side of a human-sized target 
(front, back, or either side). 

e If a character tries to run away from a 
fight that has already started, any oppo- 
nents fighting the character get to make 
a final attack. This applies to both mon- 
sters and heroes. 


Performing Actions 
A character can perform one action in a 
round. Simple actions require time but don’t 
require any dice rolls. These include draw- 
ing a weapon from a scabbard, retrieving a 
dropped weapon, readying a magical item, 
drinking a potion, moving, binding a char- 
acter’s wounds, or searching a dead body. 

Ability Checks: Other types of actions can 
be handled by ability checks. To make an abili- 
ty check, a player must roll less than or equal 
to his or her character’s specific Ability Score 
on a d20. (Low rolls are good for ability 
checks, high rolls are bad!) With an ability 
check, a DM can determine if a character suc- 
ceeds at a physical or mental feat not covered 
by other rules. 

Examples of ability checks include pushing 
a large object out of the way (Strength check), 
leaping over a gaping pit (Dexterity check), 
overcoming the effects of eating spoiled food 
(Constitution check), determining if a charac- 
ter recalls an old legend (Intelligence check), 
seeing if a character spots an obscure clue 
(Wisdom check), and negotiating with a mon- 
ster (Charisma check). 

Use common sense when calling for ability 
checks. If an action is just completely impos- 
sible (leaping the Grand Canyon comes to 


mind) or exceedingly easy, then no roll is 
required. The DM will say, “That looks like 
an impossible feat.” If the player still wants 
his character to attempt it, the DM will say, 
“Okay. The hero makes a running leap .. . 
and falls far short of the other side. He hits 
the rocky ground many long seconds later. It 
isn’t a pretty sight... .” 

The DM can also modify the check to 
match the situation. Subtract from the die 
roll for easier tasks, add to the die roll for 
more difficult tasks. Sample modifiers are 
listed below. The DM can adjust the modi- 
fiers as he or she sees fit. 


Type of Situation Modifier 
Extremely Easy —6

Character Abilities: The Hero Folders list 
abilities that may only be available to a par- 
ticular character. These abilities, such as the 
thief’s skills, are explained on the folders. 

Searching: Sometimes a character might 
want to search an area for hidden things. A 
searching hero might find a secret door, a par- 
tially buried clue, or a discarded bit of treas- 
ure. Searching takes time; it takes 10 rounds 
to search a 10-foot by 10-foot area. It can’t be 
done in the middle of combat or with hostile 
creatures around. Each character can search 
an area once. 

When a player declares that his character is 
searching, the DM secretly makes a Wisdom 
check for the hero. The DM can modify the 
check according to the situation. The DM 
makes the check even if there is nothing to 
find so that the players are never certain if 
their characters missed something important 
or not.

Casting Spells 

Magic exists in the imaginary world depicted 
in the D&D game. The power to call forth 
magic is gathered by spellcasters during a 
restful process that occurs between adven- 
tures. Wizards study their spell books and 
memorize the spells they need. Priests pray 
to their gods for the spells of their faith. 
Once cast, the spell is used up and can’t be 
cast again until the character has rested. 

Characters with wizard or priest magic 
can cast spells. Only those characters with 
the spellcasting ability listed on their Hero 
Folders can cast spells. 

To cast a spell, the player announces which 
spell her hero is casting during her turn in a 
round. At the end of the round, spells go off 
in the order in which they were cast and the 
effects take place. See the spell descriptions in 
the Hero Folders for individual spell effects. 

Once a spell is cast, the player marks it 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 11 


RD, 


off. That spell can’t be used again until the 
hero has rested and re-memorized it. 

Casting a spell is an action. In the round 
that a hero casts a spell, he can move up to 
half his move number. 

If the spellcaster is successfully attacked 
before he gets to act in a round, he can’t cast 
a spell that round. 

Resting: If the heroes get a full night's rest, 
uninterrupted by wandering monsters or other 
dangers, they receive a few benefits. First, those 
who rest regain 1 hit point; reduce any wounds 
suffered by 1 point. Second, spellcasters regain 
their full compliment of spells. 

Saving Throws: To avoid the effects of 
harmful spells or some monster attacks, char- 
acters get to make saving throws. Every char- 
acter has a saving throw number. To make a 
saving throw, the character’s player rolls a 
d20 and tries to get a number equal to or 
greater than the saving throw number. 

If a saving throw fails, the character receives 
the full effects of the spell or special attack. If a 
saving throw succeeds, the character either suf- 
fers no effects or receives half the total damage. 
See the spell or monster descriptions for com- 
plete details. 

Note that saving throws don’t work against 
all spells. If a spell description states that no 
saving throw is allowed, then the target of 
that spell doesn’t get to make a roll. 


Gaining Experience 

Heroes gain experience by working together, 
defeating monsters, completing specific 
quests, and coming up with good ideas that 
enhance the group’s storytelling fun. 

The ready-to-play adventures list the 
amount of experience the heroes gain. The 
DM’s section later in this book gives addi- 
tional guidelines. 

Write the number of XPs gained on your 
character’s Hero Folder. When the XPs equal or 
exceed the number listed for the next highest 
level, your hero goes up a level! With a new 


12 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


level, heroes gain more hit points, improve 
their THACOs and certain character abilities, 
and spellcasters increase the number of spells 
they can cast in a day. See the Hero Folders for 
more details. 


A Game Session 


How do you really play a D&D game? After 
you've decided to be the DM and you've 
read this book, looked over the Hero Folders, 
and read the first adventure, get a few 
friends together. You need at least one other 
friend to play, and there are enough folders 
for up to eight players plus the DM. 

Find a comfortable place with a flat sur- 
face to roll the dice on. The kitchen table 
works nicely. The DM sits where the other 
players can’t look over his shoulder and 
puts the DM Screen up in front of him so 
that it hides the Adventures Book and his 
scrap paper. It also provides a spot where he 
can roll the dice in secret. 

The players need their Hero Folders, scrap 
and mapping paper, and pencils. Plenty of 
snacks and beverages are also recommended, 
as a D&D game session is as much a social 
event as it is an epic quest. 

When the players roll the dice, they should 
roll them openly so that everyone can see the 
results. The DM may make some rolls behind 
the screen for suspense and to maintain mys- 
tery, but all combat rolls should be rolled so 
the players can see them. 

A game session can last as long as you 
want, but two to four hours is a good 
amount of time. Remember, your heroes’ 
adventures continue the next time you get 
together to play! 


Last Words for Players 


The first couple of game sessions might be a bit 
uneven as you and your friends learn how to play 
the game. Players are allowed to refer to their Hero 
Folders and the beginning of this book (up to this 
page) at any time during a game session. The 
players should not look at the DM portions of this 
book or any of the Adventures Book. The excite- 
ment of facing unknown monsters and discover- 
ing new magic can be spoiled if someone other 
than the DM looks up details during play. 

During the game, the players have a few tasks 
to handle in addition to playing their characters. 
Every gaming group needs a mapper, a caller, and a 
recorder. 

The mapper draws the map of the dungeon the 
characters are exploring. The Hero Folder for Niles 
the Thief has a mapmaking kit. Draw the map in 
pencil, as the DM describes its twists and turns, so 
that you can better imagine the scene. 

The caller announces what the adventuring 
party is doing. The caller checks with the other 
players whenever a decision must be made and 
tells the DM what the consensus is. The caller 
doesn’t tell the other players what to do; she 
speaks with the other players and reports to the 
DM with detailed information. “We’re marching 
north up the corridor; what do we see,” the caller 
might say. During combat, the DM will bypass the 
caller and ask each player what his or her charac- 
ter is doing. 

The recorder keeps notes about the adventure, 
writing down important clues and keeping track 
of all monsters the party has defeated and any 
treasure they have found. This helps the DM 
award experience at the end of the game session. 

Marching Order: The players should decide 
how their characters are arranged. Characters 
move around either in single file or two by two. 
Fighters or heroes with the best Armor Class or hit 
points should be in front. Spellcasters and weaker 
heroes should be situated in the center for maxi- 
mum protection. If you ever decide to change the 
order, let the DM know. 


Dividing Treasure: As your characters adven- 
ture, they’re going to accumulate treasure. 
Treasure comes in two forms: magical and normal 


treasure. Don’t base how much treasure a hero 
gets on how much time a hero spent in the spot- 
light. Every hero shares in the risk equally, so all 
should share equally in the treasure. 

Magical items should be given to the characters 
that can best use them. If any “general use” magi- 
cal items remain, have each player roll a d20. High 
roller picks an item, then the next highest, etc., 
until all magical treasure is passed out. 

All normal treasure (gems, gold, non-magical 
items, etc.) should be divided equally among all 
the heroes. 

The Game Session: Pick an evening or week- 
end afternoon or some other convenient time 
when you and your friends can spend a few hours 
playing the D&D game. Set a time limit and stop 
playing about 15 minutes early so the DM has 
time to wrap things up. (Two to four hours is a 
good length for a typical game session.) 

Your very first game session begins with the 
DM describing a location beneath the small village 
of Haven. Listen carefully to the descriptions and 
play the role of your character as the situation 
develops. 

When the heroes run into monsters, the fighters 
should move forward to meet the threat. Wizards 
need to stay back to cast spells, while thieves and 
priests may want to serve as rear guards. Of 
course, if the fighters need help, any hero can leap 
into the fray! 

Not every encounter is solved by battle, howev- 
er. Sometimes adventurers gain more by talking 
their way through a situation if the other side is 
willing to negotiate. 

There are times when a particular character’s 
talents are called for. A thief might want to move 
to the head of the group to check for traps or pick 
a lock, or a cleric might advance when attempting 
to “turn” undead creatures. After doing the job, 
these heroes should return to their normal spot in 
the marching order. 

It’s Your Character: Sometimes you'll disagree 
about the best course of action. That’s okay. Just 
remember that you control your character’s 
actions. You get the final say as to what your char- 
acter is doing. After that, the DM tells you what 
happens.

For the DM Only 


The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game has a 
unique element that makes it different from 
all other games. One player assumes the 
special role of the Dungeon Master. The DM 
is a movie director, storyteller, and central 
processing unit all in one. The DM tells the 
players what their characters see and hear, 
determines the outcomes of their actions, 
and keeps the adventure moving. With a 
DM, players can have their characters try 
anything or go anywhere. The only limit in 
the D&D game is your imagination. 

If you're reading this section, you must 
want to be the DM for your group. 
Congratulations! The DM’s role is not only 
the most important in the game, it’s also the 
most challenging. You have to narrate the 
adventures, run all the characters and mon- 
sters not controlled by the players, and 
determine the course of the story by evaluat- 
ing the players’ actions and die rolls. If 
you're up to the challenge, keep reading. A 
good DM is worth his or her weight in gold! 


WO

DM Laws 
The DM decides what happens, using the 
actions the players declare for their charac- 
ters, the game rules, and her imagination. If 
in doubt, just make it up! It’s better to keep 
the story moving and the game fun than to 
get bogged down in the details. 

Use ability checks to determine success if 
the players want their characters to try 


14 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


things not covered by any other rules. 

If an action is just impossibly difficult or 
ridiculously easy, the DM can decide that it 
automatically fails or succeeds. 

Remember that the DM isn’t competing 
against the players, even though he controls 
the monsters that challenge the heroes. 
Instead, the DM is like a referee, helping to 
advance the story by deciding how the play- 
ers’ actions influence each situation. 

Above all else, the DM must always be 
fair. If you determine that a rule works in a 
specific way, it should work that way all the 
time. If one hero can’t leap across the giant 
pit, don’t arbitrarily decide that another 
hero can. Be consistent and the game will 
make sense to the players and a good time 
will be had by all. 

It isn’t the DM’s story or the players’ 
story—it’s the group’s story. The DM is just 
around to help it along and to narrate it for 
the players. 


DM Basics 

The DM plays the D&D game by running 
the adventures for the other players. So, the 
DM gets to read an adventure beforehand, 
think about the possible outcomes, then 
bring the story to life as the players add 
their contribution to the adventure. (The 
players are the main characters of the story, 
the heroes!) 

Before you play the first game session, 
read the first adventure in the Adventures 
Book. Things will go more smoothly if you 
have a good feel for the pace of the story. 


Read or paraphrase the read-aloud text. In 
the adventures, read-aloud text is presented 
in boxes. The text sets a scene, offers 
descriptions, or sets up a situation that the 
heroes must react to. 

Then ask the players what their characters 
are going to do. Use the game rules, the 
encounter secrets (the text not presented in 
boxes), the players’ actions, and your own 
judgment and imagination to determine 
what happens. 

If the scene involves monsters or other 
characters, you must play their roles. The 
adventure provides suggestions for how to 
do this, but you'll have to do what feels 
right in any given situation. 

Our best advice to you is to have fun and 
be fair. The rest comes together like magic! 


Narrating an Adventure 

The read-aloud portions of each adventure 
provide information that the characters can 
see, hear, or smell at a particular point in the 
story. After you provide this information, 
the players may have questions. Be careful 
not to give away any secrets! For example, 
don’t tell them what’s on the other side of a 
closed door before the characters open it. 

You might say, “There’s a door at the 
end of the hall.” The players might 
respond, “What kind of door?” Check the 
text following the read-aloud box to see if 
there are any obvious details you can share 
with the players. For example, the text may 
tell you that the door is made of iron, with 
no knob or keyhole. If the players ask, you 
can tell them this, as it’s obvious their 
characters can see it. If it doesn’t provide 
any additional details, you get to make 
something up. That’s what DMs do; 
they’re allowed to fill in the blanks. 

Never reveal whether or not something is in 
the adventure or if you’re making it up. Just 
don’t get carried away or attempt to reveal too 
many details and the players won’t know if 


Z 
S TS 
e 


ey 
SAAS 
a N 
i 
| 


it’s in the text or not. As long as you're fair 
and consistent, they won’t even care! 


Running the Monsters 

The Dungeon Master gets to run the mon- 
sters that the heroes must face in the course 
of every adventure. A selection of monsters 
is described at the end of this book, and 
each appropriate encounter in an adventure 
provides details about a particular mon- 
ster’s (or group of monsters’) goals, needs, 
and behavior. Most monsters want to 
destroy whatever comes their way, but 
some can be talked to. Remember to play 
the monsters as intelligent creatures (unless 
the text says otherwise)—monsters always 
lead with their best attack, and many will 
try to flee if severely injured. 

The DM also plays the roles of other 
characters the heroes meet. Townsfolk, such 
as the Patriarch and shopkeepers of Haven, 
and villains, like Restad the vampire, allow 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS” Rules Book 15 


the DM to do a little roleplaying, too. 
Remember that just like the players, the DM 
must separate what she knows as the DM 
from what her characters or monsters know. 


Winging It 
The D&D game isn’t just about rolling dice 
and following set encounters. Players will 
eventually try to do something that isn’t 
covered in the rules. That’s okay. In fact, 
that’s one of the best things about the 
game—you never know what's going to 
happen next! That’s why there’s a DM. 
When a situation comes up that you don’t 
have a set answer to, make something up. If 
you stick to the DM mantra (Be Fair! Be 
Consistent! Have Fun!) everything will turn 
out fine. Remember that the goal is to have 
fun and tell an exciting, challenging group 
story set in our magical world of long ago. 
Winging it is a perfectly acceptable tactic for 
handling the unexpected. 


Session One is Just the Beginning 


The D&D game is designed to be played on 
an ongoing basis. When you reach the set 
ending time for the first game session, and it 
isn’t the end of the adventure, have the 
players note the hit points and items their 
characters currently have. Spellcasters 
should also mark which spells they’ve cast. 
Put all the notes and books and Hero Folders 
back in the box so nothing gets lost between 
sessions. Then set a time for the next game 
session. And the one after that. 


16 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 


Awarding Experience 
End the story portion of each game session 
about 15 minutes early so that you can 
award experience and the players can divide 
the treasure among their characters. 
Experience point awards for monsters are 
listed in the monster entries and in the 
adventures. Monsters don’t have to be killed 
for heroes to earn awards; they just have to 
be defeated or otherwise overcome. 
Story awards are based on how well the 
players did in the adventure. 
Individual awards include: 
e Player has a clever idea (50-100 xp) 
e Player has an idea that saves the group 
(100-500 xp) 
e Player acts out his or her character well 
(100-200 xp) 


Award experience for monsters and indi- 
vidual achievements at the end of a game 
session. Story awards should be saved until 
an adventure is completed. 

When a hero achieves enough XP to gain a 
level, that hero must find someone to train 
him. A wizard character seeks out a wizard 
of a higher level, for example, and a fighter 
goes to a warrior of higher level for training. 
See the Adventures Book for more details.

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Rules Book 19 


Dungeon Generation 
Example 


Stan wants to generate a dun- 
geon for his players using the 
Random Dungeon Generator. 
He takes a piece of mapping 
paper, and goes to Table A to 
see what kind of entrance he’s 
going to start with. He rolls a 2, 
so he draws a small chamber 
with a set of stairs in the center 
of his paper. 

With one door leading out of 
the room, Stan rolls on Table E 
to see what lies on the other 
side of the door, getting a 9— 
another room. Stan rolls on 
Table H and gets a 16, a rectan- 
gular 30x40-foot room. 

He then checks Table J and 
gets a 10—two exits. He checks 
Table K, under the section for 
two exits, and rolls a 6, so he 
knows that one exit goes on each 
side of the room from the origi- 
nal door. Stan finally rolls twice 
on Table D, getting a 19 and a 12, 
so he marks on his map that one 
of the exits is a locked metal 
door and the other is actually a 
hallway, which he makes 20 feet 
long. Finally, he marks a “1” on 
this room, so his map now looks 
something like this: 


Now Stan wants to figure out 
what is in the room he just 
added, so he rolls on Table L 
and gets a 5—a monster! Stan 
rolls 1d8 and 1d12 and adds 
them together, then looks on 
Table M (deciding against using 
the Special Monsters table so 
early in the dungeon) and the 
result is myconid. Stan rolls 1d4 
and gets a 3, so he takes a piece 
of notebook paper and writes 
on the top line, “1: 3 myconids. 
He figures he'll go back later 
and roll their hit points. 

Now Stan is ready to find out 
where that corridor leads (he 
could also choose to find out 
what's on the other side of the 
locked metal door by checking 
Table E), so he rolls on Table B 
and gets an 11—a side passage. 
He rolls on Table G and gets a 
4, so he draws in the appropri- 
ate side passage to the left of 
the current one, extending both 
of them 20 feet. 

Deciding to continue check- 
ing on his current passage, Stan 
rolls on Table B again and 
comes up with a 5; there’s a 
door in the passageway. He 
goes to Table C and rolls a 9, so 
he draws a door on the right- 
hand side of the hall, then con- 
tinues the passage another 20 
feet. Still interested in where 
this passage goes, he rolls on 
Table B once more, and gets a 
19, a trick or trap. 

Stan marks a “2” on his map 
at that spot in the hallway, then 
rolls on Table I, getting a 6. 
There’s a 10-foot-deep pit here, 
so he writes on his piece of 
notebook paper the following: 
“2: Hidden pit trap, 10’ deep.” 
He remembers from the 
Adventures Book that a pit trap

like this inflicts 1d6 points of 
damage, so he adds, “Front row 
of marching order roll a 
Dexterity check to avoid falling 
in, characters who do fall suffer 
1d6 damage.” 

Stan extends the hallway 
another 20 feet on his map, 
which now looks like this: 


Example B 


EELA

pA BA 


At this point, Stan can contin- 
ue to see where this hallway 
goes, move to the side passage 
that showed up earlier, or check 
either of the doors (the one in 
the hallway or the locked metal 
one back in room 1). By the time 
he’s finished, he will have filled 
his entire sheet of mapping 
paper with rooms, corridors, 
doors, and numbered encoun- 
ters, and his piece of notebook 
paper will have a complete list 
of each numbered encounter. 

Even though he’s rolling up 
this dungeon randomly, he will 
ignore results that don’t make 
sense (like a hallway that dou- 
bles back to where stuff is 
already drawn) or that let his 
map go off the edge of the 
page. He might even choose at 
some point to place a very large 
room that has a weird shape or 
size, and then put one of the 
really special monsters (like the 
dragon or the vampire) in it. 


Monsters 


Monsters inhabit the imagi- 
nary world of the D&D game. 
Some of these foul and amaz- 
ing creatures are drawn from 
legends and mythology. 
Others have been specially cre- 
ated for this game. 

AC Stands for Armor Class 
and describes a monster’s 
defense. Level is a measure of 
its power. Monsters roll 1d8 
per level to generate hit points 
(unless otherwise noted). 3+1 
indicates that the monster has

3d8+1 hit points. THAC is its 
attack number. Actions is the 
number of attacks it gets in a 
round. Damage is the amount 
of damage it inflicts on a suc- 
cessful attack. Alt. Attack is 
short for Alternate Attack and 
describes another attack form 
the monster can use. Sp. 
Defense is short for Special 
Defense and describes some- 
thing unusual that protects a 
monster from certain attacks. 
Saving Throw is its defense 
number against spells. Move is 
how far it can move ina 


Carnivorous giant bats attack 
creatures, including humans, if 
they are hungry or their lairs 
are disturbed. To attack, a 
giant bat must land on its vic- 
tim. It can land and attack in 
the same round. It can’t attack 
in a round in which it takes to 
the air. 

Its high-pitched squeaks act 
like sonar, allowing it to see 
shapes in total darkness. 

When flying, the giant bat 
has an AC 5. 


Large, strong humanoids, bug- 
bears dwell and hunt in dank 
dungeons and other under- 
ground areas. 

Bugbears are greedy and 
intimidating. Their weapon of 
choice is the battle ax. While 
not brilliant, they aren’t stu- 
pid. If overmatched, they flee 
or send for help. 

Bugbears like to set ambush- 
es. In the first round of com- 
bat, they attack first. After that, 
roll for initiative normally.

distance and attack in the 
same round. Intelligence 
describes how a monster 
thinks. Attitude is how the 
monster normally approaches 
other creatures. Size is how 
large it is. 

Experience shows how 
many points the heroes receive 
for defeating the monster. This 
number is for one monster and 
is divided among the surviving 
heroes. Multiply the experience 
by the number of monsters 
defeated.

These monsters can crawl along 
walls and ceilings. If attacked 
head on, a crawler benefits 
from a tough hide (AC 3); its 
body isn’t as tough (AC 7). 

It attacks with writhing ten- 
tacles, four attacks in a round 
aimed at a single target. Each 
time a tentacle hits, the target 
must make a saving throw or 
become paralyzed for 2d6 
rounds. It munches on a para- 
lyzed victim for 1 hit point per 
round. 


The highly intelligent young 
red dragon is exceptionally 
evil and greedy. 

It attacks with both claws 
and a bite at a single target in 
a round. It can choose to use 
its breath weapon instead, 
shooting a stream of fire that 
hits everything in a front of it 
up to 30 feet away. The fire 
inflicts 2d10+1 damage. A tar- 
get that makes a saving throw 
suffers only half the amount of 
damage. 


An ettercap, often found with 
giant spiders, is a cruel and 
cunning creature. It can attack 
a single target three times in a 
round, twice with its claws 
and once with a powerful bite. 

If the bite attack is success- 
ful, a victim must make a sav- 
ing throw or be immobilized 
by the monster’s poison for 
1d8+4 rounds. Like spiders, 
the ettercap wraps poisoned 
victims in webbing for later 
consumption.

This cube of living slime 
meanders down dungeon cor- 
ridors, absorbing trash to 
slowly digest. Transparent, the 
hard-to-spot creature always 
attacks first. After the first 
round, roll for initiative. 

The cube attacks by touch- 
ing a target, who must make a 
saving throw or be paralyzed 
for 2d4 rounds. A paralyzed 
character is absorbed by the 
cube and suffers 2d4 damage 
every round. 


The disgusting, undead ghoul 
eats dead bodies for suste- 
nance. Anyone killed by a 
ghoul rises as a ghoul con- 
trolled by the DM the next 
night. 

Ghouls attack twice with 
claws and once with a bite in a 
round. Anyone hit must make 
a saving throw or become par- 
alyzed for 1d6+2 rounds. Elves 
are immune to this effect. 

A ghoul is immune to sleep, 
hold, and fear spells. It can be 
turned by a priest. 


The cyclops is a type of giant. 
Not very smart, this creature has 
a reputation for great strength 
and aggressiveness. It carries a 
massive club that is too heavy for 
human-sized characters to use. 

The raggedly dressed, one- 
eyed cyclops smells of dirt and 
sweat. It is barbaric, easily 
made angry, and sometimes 
very reckless. It hates adven- 
turers, sometimes going out of 
its way to attack them.

The fearsome and extremely 
powerful ettin is a two-headed 
giant. It receives a bonus to all 
initiative rolls, subtracting 1 
point from the total each 
round. If anything, it is cov- 
ered with even more dirt and 
filth than the related cyclops. 
The ettin fights with two 
spiked clubs. The left arm 
inflicts 2d8 damage, the right 
arm 3d6. If weaponless, its left 
fist inflicts 1d10, its right 2d6. 


An evil, humanoid hyena, the 
gnoll hates humans and elves. 
It is typically a bully, not par- 
ticularly brave, and ready to 
flee the moment the battle 
turns against it. 

The gnoll attacks with a 
weapon, usually a battle ax. A 
gnoll might also carry a bow 
and arrows (12 total ina 
makeshift quiver). 

Found in ruins or under- 
ground settings, the gnoll trav- 
els in packs. 


Small, evil, and cowardly, the 
goblin hates dwarves. A single 
goblin isn’t much of a threat. 
In great numbers, however, 
they can take even a powerful 
opponent down. 

Goblins sometimes utilize 
worgs as riding mounts and 
lair guards. It isn’t unusual for 
a gang of goblins (eight or 
more) to be led by a hobgoblin. 

Goblins don’t like to fight 
fairly. They prefer to ambush 
their enemies.

A hobgoblin is a fierce, warlike 
humanoid with an organized 
mind. It lives in a tribal mili- 
tary society, though an indi- 
vidual sometimes works as a 
mercenary for those with gold 
or power. 

The hobgoblin fights with a 
long sword or a halberd (1d10 
damage). 

Seeing itself as a “superior” 
race, a hobgoblin often rules 
over goblins or orcs. It uses 
these creatures as battle fodder. 


Crude and cowardly, a kobold 
resembles a humanoid canine. 
It can be bribed fairly easily, 
and because of its small size, it 
isn’t taken very seriously. This 
can be a fatal mistake, as a 
kobold makes up for lack of 
size with ferocity and tenacity. 

In a group, kobolds attempt 
to overwhelm opponents with 
superior numbers. They 
always attack two or three to 
one when possible. 


This savage, semi-aquatic rep- 
tilian humanoid is a scavenger 
and raider. It attacks with both 
claws (1 point of damage each) 
and a bite against the same 
target in a round, or it can 
attack once with a weapon. 
Lizardmen utilize halberds 
(1d10 damage), tridents (1d6+1 
damage), and two-handed 
swords (1d10 damage). 

These creatures sometimes 
take captives as slaves or as a 
food source.

With the head of a bull and the 
body of a very strong man, a 
minotaur can be a fearsome 
opponent. Each round, subtract 
2 points from its initiative roll. 

It attacks by goring with its 
horns (2d4 damage) and biting 
(1d4) against a single target in 
a round. Instead, it can attack 
once with its huge ax. 

It has a special attack. From 
30 feet or more away, it can 
charge an opponent and strike 
with its horns on a successful 
attack for 4d4 damage. 


This intelligent fungus lives in 
underground communities. It 
hates violence and prefers to 
be left alone. If forced, it 
punches for 2d4 damage. 

It can spray clouds of spores 
into a 20x20-foot area instead 
of attacking. One kind of spore 
allows it to communicate since 
it doesn’t talk. Another kind 
paralyzes all targets who fail a 
saving throw for 1d4 rounds. 
A third spore is poisonous 
(save or 1d4 damage). 


Big, ill-tempered, and nasty, an 
ogre lives to raid and steal. It 
has a taste for elf and dwarf 
flesh. 

An ogre attacks either with 
its meaty fists or with a huge 
club. 

This greedy creature mingles 
freely with giants and trolls. It 
sometimes serves as a merce- 
nary among orc and gnoll 
tribes. Even evil humans have 
been known to employ ogres 
as soldiers and guards from 
time to time.

This slimy horror looks like a 
wet puddle. It slides and oozes 
along dungeon floors, scav- 
enging for metal to eat. It 
strikes like a snake, causing 
damage as it seeks to eat metal 
weapons and armor. 

Metal weapons and chain 
mail dissolve in a single 
round, plate mail in two. Each 
magical plus adds one round. 
Lightning and weapons hurt 
the ooze, but metal ones dis- 
solve after causing harm.

Orcs wage constant war on 
other races, including other 
orcs, as they seek to expand 
their territory. Clans are some- 
times led by hobgoblins. 

The bloodthirsty orc has 
learned to use a variety of 
weapons due to its constant 
state of warfare. In addition to 
short swords, orcs may be 
armed with battle axes (1d8), 
hand axes (1d6), spears (1d6), 
or sometimes short bows and 
arrows (1d6). 


A horrifying combination of a 
giant owl and a great bear, this 
creature always attacks on 
sight. It is vicious and raven- 
ous, attacking with two claws 
and its beak against a single 
target in a round. 

If the owlbear’s claw attack 
hits with a roll of 18 or better, 
it drags the target into a crush- 
ing hug for an additional 2d8 
damage. Then it releases the 
victim and attacks again the 
next round.

A piercer is a gastropod that 
lives within a shell that resem- 
bles a stalactite. It clings to the 
ceilings of caves, waiting to 
sense living things. 

When a living creature pass- 
es below it, the piercer drops 
(it subtracts 5 points from its 
first initiative roll). On a suc- 
cessful attack roll, it inflicts 
1d6 damage and begins to eat 
its victim (1 point of damage 
per round). It won’t stop until 
killed. If it misses, it can be 
avoided or killed. 


This voracious monster resem- 
bles a giant pudding. When it 
senses a living creature, it 
attacks. A pudding can ooze 
through cracks and travel 
along ceilings and walls. When 
it attacks, its touch dissolves 
organic matter. 

Lightning and blows from 
weapons divide the pudding 
in two, forming two smaller 
but equally powerful crea- 
tures. Fire and magic missiles 
inflict normal damage. 


Giant rats travel and attack in 
packs. They can be aggressive, 
especially if hungry or if 
threatened. Fire frightens them 
and can drive them away. 

The bite of a giant rat carries 
a deadly disease. Any victim 
who suffers damage from a 
giant rat attack must make a 
saving throw. If the save fails, 
the victim is infected. An 
infected victim can’t be healed 
of wounds until cured by cure 
spell.

Skeletons can be animated by 
evil wizards and priests to 
serve a variety of purposes. 
They attack with rusty 
weapons that always cause 
1d6 damage. 

Edged and piercing 
weapons, such as swords and 
spears, only do half damage to 
skeletons. Blunt weapons 
(maces, staves) do normal 
damage. They are immune to 
sleep, hold, and fear spells. 
Priests can turn skeletons.

The giant snake is a massive 
constrictor that hides in high, 
concealed places. It drops to 
attack (-3 initiative bonus in 
the first round), biting for 1 
point of damage. Alternately, 
it can attempt to coil around 
its victim (on a successful 
attack). Every round there- 
after, the victim suffers 1d6 
points of damage. The victim 
can escape by making a suc- 
cessful Strength check with a 
+2 penalty to the roll. 


The giant spider is an aggres- 
sive predator. It spins webs in 
dungeons and ruins to capture 
prey. A target must make a suc- 
cessful Wisdom check to avoid 
becoming entangled in a web. 
If entangled, it takes a success- 
ful Strength check to break 
free. While entangled, the vic- 
tim can’t do anything else. 

If bitten, a victim must make 
a successful saving throw or 
suffer poison damage 
(1d10+2).

The blood-drinking stirge flies 
in groups, descending when 
warm-blooded creatures are 
nearby. They swarm a victim, 
each attempting to pierce flesh 
with its proboscis. 

On a successful attack, a vic- 
tim suffers 1d4—1 damage. 
Every round thereafter, the 
stirge drains blood (1d4 dam- 
age). It must be killed to be 
removed. When a stirge has 
drained 12 points, it is full and 
flies off to digest. 


This creature belongs to a war- 
like race that dwells beneath 
the earth. 

A troglodyte attacks with 
two claws and a bite against a 
single target in a round, or 
fights with a weapon. It 
prefers long swords (1d8 dam- 
age) and great javelins that it 
can throw to inflict 2d4 dam- 
age. It carries two javelins. 

The troglodyte’s foul odor 
inhibits actions; save or +4 
penalty to initiative rolls. 


A horrid carnivore that doesn’t 
fear death, a troll preys on all 
but the most powerful crea- 
tures. 

It attacks with two claws 
and a bite in a round; it can 
target three opponents in that 
round. 

Three rounds after it suffers 
damage it begins to regener- 
ate, healing 3 points every 
round thereafter. If reduced to 
0 hit points, it still heals. To 
kill it, it must be reduced to 0 
and then burned.

The magical unicorn protects 
forests from harm. Sometimes 
a good elf or fair maiden can 
ride a unicorn. If treated kind- 
ly, the magical creature can 
become a life-long friend. 

It receives a —6 bonus to all 
initiative rolls. It attacks with 
its front hooves and its thrust- 
ing horn. If it is more than 30 
feet away, it can charge to 
inflict 3412 damage with its 
horn. It can teleport away once 
per day. 


Unicorn 


This undead beast looks 
human until it attacks; then its 
true form is revealed. It casts 
no reflection, moves silently, 
and is destroyed by sunlight. 
Its powerful fists cause 
1d4+2 damage. If it uses a 
weapon, it receives a +1 to hit 
and +2 to damage. Most fear- 
some is its ability to drain 
Constitution points. It must hit 
successfully to drain 
Constitution. A target reduced 
to 0 Constitution dies and 
becomes a lesser vampire. 


Vampire, Lesser 


Worgs are huge wolves. They 
travel in packs, are slightly 
more intelligent than their 
smaller cousins, and tend to be 
somewhat more aggressive. 
Some think their barks are a 
primitive language. 

The worg attacks with a 
powerful bite and works with 
others to bring a target down 
swiftly. 

Worgs can be found among 
goblin tribes, serving as 
mounts or guarding the tribe’s 
lair.

They try to avoid the larger

The xvarg fights with a

It fears larger beings, but will 
fight if forced or if there are 
great numbers of the xvarg

as guards and mounts. 


A zombie is a mindless corpse 
that has been animated for

an evil wizard or priest. 

In battle, a zombie never

until it is destroyed. 

In addition to being immune 
to some spells and conditions, 
a zombie is also immune to

2 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 


What DMs Should Know 


The Dungeon Master should read through 
the D&D® Rules Book and the Hero Folders 
before reading this book. Also, take a look at 
the DM Screen. It summarizes most of the 
basic rules of play so that you don’t have to 
refer to the Rules Book too often during a 
game session. 

When you're ready, the sections that fol- 
low prepare you to run your first D&D 
adventure. Review this material before read- 
ing or attempting to run “Adventure #1: The 
Mystery of UnderTown.” 


The Adventures 


This book contains three complete adven- 
tures. They should be played in the order in 
which they are presented, as they are 
designed for progressively more powerful 
player characters. In general, the first adven- 
ture (“The Mystery of UnderTown”) is 
designed for 2nd-level heroes, the second 
(“The Haunting of Black Isle”) for 3rd-level 
heroes, and the last adventure (“To Find the 
Dragon’s Lair”) for 4th-level heroes. If you 
play them in order, the characters should 
advance at the right pace to take on the more 
difficult challenges of the next adventure. 


Item Descriptions 


At the very end of this book, you'll find 
detailed descriptions of some of the more 
unusual items listed in the game. These 
include many of the imaginary weapons, 
armor, and magical items available to the 
player characters. Refer to this section if you 
come across an item you aren’t sure about or 
if you want to find out what a particular 
magical item can do in the game. 


Preparing to Play 


You’ve read everything we asked you to, 
you've set a time for your first game session, 
and you've gotten your friends together to 
play. Now what? 

Pick a location to play that has enough 
flat surfaces for everyone to roll dice and 
write things down when they need to. 

Make sure there are refreshments for 
everyone, including food and drink. It’s 
usually a good idea to have all of the play- 
ers share in the expense; have everyone 
bring something for the group to share. 

Set up your DM Screen, books, pencil, 
and note paper in a spot that allows the 
other players to see and hear you but does- 
n't leave them looking over your shoulder 
(one end of a table is good). 

Hand each player a Hero Folder and have 
them identify who’s going to be the mapper, 
caller, and recorder. (One person can handle 
one or more of these tasks, but spread them 
around if you have enough players.) 

Have the players determine a marching 
order for their characters. This lets everyone 
know where the characters are in relation to 
each other and helps avoid confusion later. 

Go over any rules the players find confus- 
ing. Sometimes it’s better to just start play- 
ing and let everyone figure it out as you go 
along, but everyone should understand the 
basics before you begin to play. The basics 
include knowing how to roll the dice and 
read the results, understanding the contents 
of the Hero Folders, and understanding the 
underlying concept of the game. The under- 
lying concept is that this is a game that uti- 
lizes imagination and a few basic rules to 
foster an interactive group storytelling expe- 
rience. In other words, it’s a game of 
“Pretend” for grown-ups. You pretend to be 
an imaginary character in an imaginary fan- 
tasy world. 


Tips for Adventuring 


Remind players of these details before start- 
ing the first adventure. 

Iron spikes and hammer can be used to 
wedge doors open and provide grips for 
climbing, etc. 

Holy water hurts undead monsters like 
skeletons and zombies (1d6+1 damage). It 
can be thrown up to 20 feet and hits if the 
character makes a successful attack roll. 

A mirror comes in handy for signaling (if 
a light is present) or for stealthily peaking 
around corners. 

A typical 10-foot pole is made of wood and 
can be used to spring traps by poking the 
floor, tapping suspicious-looking dungeon fea- 
tures, or touching chests and barrels. 

Rations and water skins provide charac- 
ters with nourishment while they are adven- 
turing. Each set provides one character with 
enough food and drink for five days of 
heavy-duty adventuring—and all adventur- 
ing is heavy-duty! 

Rope can be tied to an iron spike to assist 
in climbing, or it can be used to restrain 
prisoners, etc. A coil has a length of 50 feet. 

The DM keeps track of time in the game 
and decides how long unusual actions 
attempted by the characters take. During 
combat, time is measured in rounds. In gen- 
eral, a character can attempt one action in a 
round. Many hours or days may pass in the 
game in a matter of minutes in the real 
world when the DM says “you travel for 
three days and arrive at the ruined tower.” 
On the other hand, a battle that fills only a 
few minutes of game time may take as long 
as an hour of real time as the players roll 
dice and play through the rounds. 

Most dungeons are dark places that don’t 
have their own light sources. Most characters 
need light to see by. They can carry torches 
or lanterns to provide such light, and flint 
and steel to ignite them. Both provide 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS?” Adventures Book 3 


ERE SLE SS PSDP PP RIOD OD, 


age a ae tea ae ame Sa Se 


enough light to illuminate an area 30 feet in 
each direction. A torch burns for one hour, a 
lantern for four hours. A lantern requires oil 
to operate. Of course, if the characters have 
light, the monsters will see them. And, if a 
character is carrying a lit torch or lantern, he 
or she has only one hand free to use a 
weapon. 

Eventually the adventurers will come 
across a door. Doors come in many forms. 
There are normal wooden doors, metal 
doors, ornate doors, and plain doors. Some 
doors are locked, others aren’t. Some have 
traps, others don’t. If a door is locked, a 
thief can pick it open or a character can try 
to force it open using a Strength ability 
check. As DM, you want to modify the 
check based on the toughness of the door 
and the quality of the lock. A character can 
try to force the door open once per round, 
but each attempt alerts whatever waits on 
the other side. 

There are even secret doors, hidden from 
view and hard to spot. A sliding wall, a door 
hidden by a tapestry or piece of furniture, or 
even a door made out of a piece of furniture 
(such as a bookcase) is considered to be a 
secret door. A successful search roll and time 
are required to find secret doors (10 minutes 
or 10 rounds, depending on the type of 
scene). 

Traps litter dungeons like the bones of 
long-dead monsters. A common trap con- 
sists of a concealed pit that dumps a charac- 
ter into it when he or she walks over it. A pit 
can contain spikes, water, a monster, or just 
hard ground. Searching for traps takes time 
(10 minutes or 10 rounds per 20 feet of room 
or corridor, depending on the situation). If a 
trap is discovered, it must still be removed 
before the area can be safely entered. 

If a character drops into a pit, he or she 
suffers falling damage. For every 10 feet a 
character falls, he suffers 1d6 points of dam- 
age. (Note that some pits have additional 


4 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 


hazards, such as spikes, that inflict addition- 
al damage.) 

Wandering Monsters add an extra ele- 
ment of danger and suspense to every 
adventure. For every 60 feet an adventuring 
group travels through a dungeon, every 
minute they spend searching or standing 
around in a dungeon, or twice a day (morn- 
ing and night) when in unexplored wilder- 
ness, roll a check (1d20). On a result of 1 or 
2, a monster has wandered by. Use Table M 
at the back of the Rules Book (in the 
Random Dungeon Generation section) to 
determine what kind of monster and how 
many. Note that wandering monsters might 
not always be appropriate to a scene or 
adventure. The DM must exercise some 
judgment in this regard. 


Rolling Modified Dice 


Some monsters, weapons, and other die rolls 
have a negative modifier attached to their 
notations. For example, an ettercap inflicts 
1d4-1 points of damage with its claw. Roll 
the d4 and subtract 1 from the result. Note 
that the result (damage, etc.) will never be 
less than 1. 


The Town of Haven 


The Vale is a small farming community nes- 
tled in a broad, wooded valley. Haven, the 
largest town in the area, rests alongside the 
rambling Gryphon River. The heroes (the 
characters detailed in the Hero Folders) grew 
up in the Vale and know Haven and its resi- 
dents very well. 

The material below should be used in 
conjunction with the map of Haven that’s 
printed on the front of the DM Screen. Each 
numbered location is described in the fol- 
lowing text. 

The heroes can use Haven as a base of 
operations, a place to go to rest between 
adventures, buy supplies, receive training, 
heal their wounds, and gather rumors 


concerning events in the Vale. 

Training is required before a character can 
advance in level. The character must have 
acquired the appropriate amount of experi- 
ence points. Then the character must find a 
teacher who specializes in one of the primary 
disciplines—fighter, wizard, thief, priest. The 
cost depends on the trainer, and the time 
required is a number of weeks equal to the 
new level. So, if Mitchifer earns enough XP 
to advance to 3rd level, he must pay the 
Patriarch 300 gp and spend three weeks 
studying with the elder priest to gain the 
benefits of the new level. 


1. Temple of the Holy Defender 


This holy place is the spiritual center of the 
Vale. The Patriarch, high priest of the tem- 
ple, is a gray-bearded man whose age shows 
in the bend of his back and the air of wis- 
dom that hangs around him. 

The Patriarch offers morning and evening 
prayers in the temple (which aren’t as well 
attended as he would like), provides spiritu- 
al advice and comfort to the people of 
Haven and the surrounding farms, and 
offers his blessing to the community in a 
variety of ways. He is a warm, kind-hearted 
old man who loves the Vale and its people. 

The Patriarch provides the following serv- 
ices at the temple that adventurers might 
want to take advantage of, with the cost per 
character listed: 

e Healing all wounds, 100 gp 

Curing poison or disease, 250 gp 
Removing a curse, 500 gp 

Training priests, 100 gp per level of priest 
Restoring life, 1,000 gp per level of 
deceased character 


Restoring life isn’t an easy miracle to per- 
form. The Patriarch requires a hefty dona- 
tion to cast such a spell. When a character is 
restored to life, his or her Constitution score 
is permanently reduced by 1 point. 


In addition, the Patriarch expects a tithe 
from the heroes as members of the commu- 
nity. Ten percent of any treasure they earn 
makes a reasonable tithe. Mitchifer and 
Peregrine might feel obliged to give more. 
(The players may decide that their charac- 
ters won't provide a tithe to the temple. If 
this is the case, the Patriarch doubles all fees 
for services.) 


2. Patriarch’s House 

The Patriarch lives in this beautiful house 
next to the temple. If he ever calls the heroes 
to his study, then they will meet with him in 
his home. 


3. Willow Inn 


The road through the Vale connects: Haven 
with the rest of the world, and sometimes 
merchants and other travelers visit the town. 
This inn provides lodging (5 gp per day), 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS?” Adventures Book 5 


All of the people who live in or visit 
Haven, with the exception of the player 
characters, are controlled by the DM. Ifa 
particular character isn’t described, you 
should make up a personality to fit the role 
(the butcher, the baker, or the innkeeper, for 
instance). 

Explain to the players whenever you 
take on a role so they can imagine the 
scene and understand what’s happening. 
For example, tell them “I’m speaking as 
the Patriarch now” when they enter the 
temple to seek the elder priest’s services. 

If you want to have some fun with this, 
adopt a different voice for every charac- 
ter. Speak slower for some, louder for oth- 
ers. Use accents if you're even a little 
good at it, or an old man’s voice, or a 
deep voice, or a squeaky voice. You don’t 
have to do this, of course. Just informing 
the players that you're playing a role is 
sufficient. But the game can be a lot more 
fun with little touches like this. 


fine hot meals (2 gp per plate), and a sedate 
drinking hall where a traveler can wash 
away the dust of the road. 


4. Merry Minotaur Tavern 


This rowdy drinking hall opens in the late 
afternoon and closes just before dawn. 
Music, friendly serving wenches, cold meat 
and cheese plates (1 gp), hot stew (1 gp), and 
a variety of strong drinks (1 gp per mug) 
make this a lively and often crowded estab- 
lishment. Lady Ostur, owner of the Merry 
Minotaur, offers a few rooms for travelers 
who don’t require the luxury and cleanliness 
of the Willow (2 gp per night). 

One of Lady Ostur’s regulars, Dagger 
Daneer, is an expert thief who made a for- 
tune in some far-away city and has retired to 
the Vale at the not-so-advanced age of 29. Of 


6 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 


course, few know of her adventurous past, 
or that she is secretly Lady Ostur’s partner. 
However, Niles knows all about the lovely 
Daneer and can go to her for training when 
he needs it. (She charges 150 gp per level of 
the student.) 


5. Stable 


The town stable is owned by the blacksmith, 
though he has a halfling horse handler 
named Ulan to run it. Horses can be stabled 
for 1 gp per day, which includes feeding and 
grooming. 


6. Blacksmith 


The blacksmith of Haven is a dwarf named 
Falgur Ironstone. An expert smith and a 
respected leader of the community, 
Ironstone also serves as captain of the town 
watch (area 12). He can train fighters at a 
cost of 100 gp per level. He also has a selec- 
tion of non-magical armor and weapons, as 
listed on the back of some of the Hero 
Folders, for sale. 


7. Kosi’s General Goods 

Kosi, a young widow who took over this 
store after her husband died suddenly last 
winter, sells nonmagical items useful for 
adventuring. These items, such as backpacks 
and belt pouches, are listed on the back of 
some of the Hero Folders. 


8. Haven Graveyard 


A wooden fence surrounds this graveyard, 
which is cared for by the Temple of the Holy 
Defender. 


9. Tailor 
A mender of clothing and a maker of suits 
and dresses operates out of this small shop. 


10. Tanner 


A worker of leather and maker of leather 
goods operates out of this small shop. 


11. Scribe 


A scribe works out of this small shop. He 
offers his services to traveling merchants, as 
well as to the local shopkeepers, farmers, 
and town officials. All official records are 
prepared by the scribe for a modest fee. 


12. Watch Tower 


The guards of the town watch use this stone 
tower as a base of operations. The tower 
also features a lock-up where drunks and ` 
unruly thugs can be stored until they calm 
down. Blacksmith Ironstone (area 6) is the 
captain of the watch, though he rarely takes 
a turn in the tower. He has four 1st-level 
fighters who help him keep the peace and 
watch over the town. 


13. Town Elder 

This fine home is occupied by the Elder of 
Haven and his family. Kestin Pane is the 
Elder, essentially the mayor of Haven. 


14. Hall of Elders 


Other influential members of the Vale meet 
here to discuss important topics and to hear 
petitions from the community. Elder Pane, 
the Patriarch, Falgur Ironstone, Farmer 
Mingof, and Lady Ostur are among the most 
prominent Vale citizens. 


15. Old Aljero’s Cottage 

Nestled in the forest, not far from the river, 
sits the home of Old Aljero. This wizard 
rarely gets involved in the affairs of the 
community, and the path to his home isn’t 
always easy to find. (It can magically hide 
whenever he doesn’t want to be disturbed.) 
He will take time to train Thaddeus and 
Sunblayze, however, at a cost of 150 gp per 
level of the student. 


16. Black Isle 
In the middle of the Gryphon River, con- 
nected to the land by a covered bridge, 


Black Isle was once the home of the Temple 
of the Holy Defender. A terrible accident 
laid waste to the holy island, and now the 
place is considered to be haunted. 


Adventure #1: 
The Mystery of UnderTown 


This adventure pits the heroes against an evil 
menace that has invaded the underground 
chambers beneath the town of Haven. The 
town is threatened, so the town elders have 
appealed to the heroes for help. 

For this first adventure, we’re going to start 
the adventurers right in the dungeon. The 
read-aloud section below brings the players 
up to speed and gives them enough details to 
begin play. Everything else should become 
clear as the adventure unfolds. 

The map on the following page shows the 
layout of the dungeon. The characters are 
equipped with everything listed on their 
Hero Folders. Find out the marching order, 
who’s holding the torch (or whatever light 
source they are using), and read the shaded 
text below to start the action. 


The elders called upon you to aid the 
town of Haven, a place that has been 
your home all your life. You and your 
companions listened to Ironstone, captain 
of the town watch, as he explained what 
he discovered in the watch tower earlier 
this day. 

“The tower was locked from the inside 
when I arrived to check on my men,” 
Ironstone said in his rumbling voice. “I 
smashed the door and found both of my 
soldiers murdered, as though someone 
had taken an ax to them while they sat 
waiting for their relief to arrive.” 

At the tower, you found a hidden panel 
in the floor that led to a secret room 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 7 


beneath the tower. Ironstone promised a 
reward, and with a nod of encouragement 
from him, you all descended into the dark- 
ness below. ... 


Note the location marked “1” on the 
map. This is where the heroes begin this 
adventure. Give the players a moment to 
describe their characters to each other. 
Remind them that the characters have 
known each other all their lives and that 
they are good friends. If they ask, Ironstone 
promised the companions a suitable reward 
and the gratitude of the town elders if they 
can discover who or what murdered his sol- 
diers. 


1. Into the Depths 


A crude ladder descends 20 feet into a 
rough-hewn chamber carved into the very 
stone beneath the town. The chamber 
appears ancient, perhaps older than Haven 
itself. A passage leads out of the chamber 
to the south; another leads to the east. An 
extinguished fire pit occupies the eastern 
side of the chamber, surrounded by crude 
bedding and a stack of wooden crates. 


Every good adventure begins with a ques- 
tion from the DM to the players: “What do 
you want to do?” How the players answer 
that question sets the stage for the action 
their characters participate in. 


What's in this Chamber? 
If the characters look around the chamber, 
here’s what they can discover. 

The ladder is made of stout branches tied 
together with crude rope. It looks fairly new. 
There are splotches of wet blood visible in a 
few places. 


8 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 


ROE RE ROR ROE REE REE REE ROR EO RETRO 


The fire pit is warm, as though the fire 
was extinguished fairly recently. 

There are no markings on the walls. 

The bedding consists of filthy, bug-infest- 
ed straw and old cloth. If anyone decides to 
search the straw and makes a successful 
check, 3 gp can be found in one of the beds. 

The wooden crates look like they fell off a 
merchant's wagon. From the amount of dirt 
and scratch marks visible, they probably fell 
off a long time ago. If the characters examine 
the crates (no search rolls necessary), they dis- 
cover rations and wine skins that were proba- 
bly taken from the watch tower above. There 
are enough rations to feed six characters for 
four weeks. Also, a belt pouch that belonged 
to one of Ironstone’s murdered soldiers is 
inside one of the crates. It contains 5 gp. 


Are There Any Monsters? 

No, although it obviously looks like some- 
one was camped in this chamber within the 
last day or so. 


Should You Roll for Wandering Monsters? 

If the characters decide to carefully search 
the chamber (as opposed to having a quick 
look around and then moving into one of the 
side passages), roll for a wandering monster. 

If the check succeeds (1 or 2 on 1d20), the 
monsters that appear are xvarg. There are 
1d4 of them. They wander into the chamber 
from the east passage, arguing among them- 
selves. They stop abruptly when they get 
close to the fire pit, appear to notice the 
heroes for the first time, gasp comically, and 
attempt to flee back the way they came. 

Roll for initiative and let the players 
decide if their characters let the xvarg escape 
or if they give chase. (If the players go first, 
the xvarg can be attacked immediately; if 
the xvarg go first, they run toward location 
“2” and must be chased.)

moves, have that character’s player roll

in that 10-foot section of the corridor. 
(Here’s where knowing the marching order

Falling rocks damage everyone in the 10- 
foot square in which they fall. Roll 1d4 for 
each affected character each time an ava- 
lanche occurs to determine the amount of 
damage a character suffers.

...and either succeeds in the attempt, they 
notice the condition of the corridor. Tell the 
players that any excessive weight could 
cause more of the ceiling to cave in. There is 
no way to remove this trap. Once they 
understand the danger to their characters, 
it’s up to the players to decide if they want 
to risk this path or go in another direction.

become the home of some

the piercer gets a -5 bonus

ter in the vicinity. There 


are only two piercers in each of the three 


dead-end sections.

4. Xvarg Lair 
Xvarg (20) Three different corridors 
lead from the dungeon 
into this large chamber. 
Two great stone columns 
support the ceiling, and 
crude wooden fences 
have been erected to sep- 
arate this area from the rest of the complex. 

A tribe of xvarg inhabit this section of the 
dungeon. Unlike most xvarg, these are not 
overly hostile. They were not involved in the 
murder of the town watch, nor do they have 
any intention of invading Haven. They are 
content to live peacefully in this comfortable 
location, venturing above only to hunt small 
game and occasionally “forage” in the 
unlocked barns of the Vale’s farmers. 

There are 30 xvarg here, including 8 
males, 12 females, and 10 children. The chil- 
dren do not fight. 

If the heroes ignore this location, the only 
trouble they may have with the xvarg will be 
if they encounter any wandering through the 
dungeon. If they decide to attack the xvarg 
camp, the xvarg fight back to defend their 
home. If six or more xvarg fall in this defense, 
the remainder lose hope and flee through the 
southern passage. This passage leads to the 
surface, emerging near the river not far from 
Old Aljero’s cottage. 

If the heroes attack without provocation, 
they receive no experience points for slaugh- 
tering the xvarg. 

If the heroes approach one of the wooden 
fences, read the following: 


AC: f 
Hp: 6 each 
THACO: 20 


Actions: 1

XP: 15 each 


A crudely constructed wooden barricade 
blocks the corridor ahead. It reaches from 
the floor to the ceiling, its sharpened 
points falling just short of the stone over- 
head. You can see that there are view 
holes cut in the barrier about two feet or 


so above the floor. Red eyes appear ina 
few of these holes and a high-pitched 
voice calls out, “Who approaches the 
Kingdom of Teg?” 


If the Heroes Are Nice... 

... they can learn a few things from the 
xvarg. Being nice involves not attacking the 
camp, not threatening the tiny creatures, and 
showing at least a modicum of respect for 
King Teg (the leader of the clan). If the 
heroes also offer a gift of some sort, they 
become honorary “best friends” of the xvarg. 

If the heroes are nice, the xvarg explain 
that they have lived here “forever.” They 
have no intention of attacking the “big peo- 
ple town” and swear they haven't killed 
anyone. 

“It was probably the bugbears,” one of 
the xvarg speculates. “Since they moved ina 
few months ago, the dungeon has become a 
terrible place.” The xvarg tell them that the 
bugbears have taken over the western 
chambers. 

If the heroes are especially nice or indicate 
that they’re going to deal with the bugbear 
infestation, one xvarg speaks up. “Many 
xvarg have been enslaved by the bugbears. 
Will you set them free?” The heroes can 
agree or refuse as they see fit. 


If the Heroes Are Nasty... 

... the xvarg refuse to 
open their barricades or 
tell the heroes anything. 
“Go away, big nose!” 
shouts one xvarg. “Flee or 
face the wrath of King 
Teg, you stupid giants!” 
shouts another. The 
heroes won’t learn any-

ieas six giant rats to help them 


protect their lair. If the 
heroes pass through the barriers, the rats aid 
the xvarg in the battle. 


What's in This Chamber? 

Besides the 30 xvarg, the chamber contains 
bedding, fire pits, and the xvarg stores. The 
xvarg have a variety of dead animals they 
use for food, as well as a selection of nuts, 
berries, herbs, and other vegetation they use 
to supplement their diet. 

In addition, there is a variety of crude 
weapons, loot totalling 15 gp (though the 
heroes must search for two hours to find it all), 
and a few sacks of grain from Althisi’s farm. 


5. Pit Traps 


The bugbears have set up two pit traps to 
hinder anyone attempting to invade their 
underground lair. 


If the heroes are being cautious... 

. .. let the lead characters in the marching 
order attempt Wisdom ability checks to spot 
the poorly concealed pits. A success indi- 
cates that the character notices the large car- 
pet of fresh straw covering a portion of the 
otherwise dusty floor. Let the players 
decide what this means and how they want 
to proceed. 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS? Adventures Book 11 


Adjusting the Challenge 

The adventures in this book are written for 
a party of four adventurers. If there are less 
than four heroes running through the 
adventures, reduce the number of monsters 
in each encounter by half. So, four bug- 
bears becomes two bugbears, for example. 

If there are more than four heroes, 
you'll need to make the encounters a bit 
more challenging. For five or six heroes, 
increase the number of monsters by one. 
So, four bugbears become five bugbears. 
For seven or eight characters, double the 
number of monsters (four bugbears 
becomes eight bugbears). 

Don’t increase the number for Restad the 
Vampire or Moltenclaw the Dragon. Instead, 
just increase the number of supporting mon- 
sters in those adventures, as outlined above. 

Use your judgment. The goal is to pres- 
ent a challenge, not overwhelm the heroes. 


If the heroes aren’t careful ... 

... they walk right into the trap. The lead 
characters in the marching order plunge 
through the straw and fall 10 feet (1d6 dam- 
age). The characters in the second row of the 
marching order must make successful 
Dexterity ability checks or they also fall into 
the pit and take damage. 


6. A Pair of Bugbears 


If the heroes enter this chamber, read the fol- 
lowing: 


A crude ladder, much like the one you 
descended from the watch tower, rests. 
against the far wall. A mound of dirt and 
rocks beside it indicate that the hole above 
was recently opened. Suddenly, you hear 
rough laughter from above. Someone or 
something is climbing down the ladder!

They were up above, 
spying on the town and 
working up a strategy for 
attack. One of them car- 
ries a large sack. 

If the heroes decide to 
attack, don’t roll initiative. The bugbears 
aren’t expecting any trouble so the heroes can 
surprise them and attack first in the first 
round of combat. 

If the heroes wait and try to talk to the 
bugbears, roll initiative. The monsters don’t 
talk to the adventurers; they just attack and 
make as much noise as possible to alert their 
companions. 

Every round the battle lasts after the first 
round, check for wandering monsters. 
Because the bugbears are making a lot of 
noise, increase the chance of an encounter to 
1-5 on 1d20. If a wandering monster is indi- 
cated, 1d4~—2 bugbears arrive in 2 rounds. 
After that, don’t check for wandering mon- 
sters any more for this battle. 


Note: ambush sit- 
uation; bugbears 
don’t attack first 


What’s in the Sack? 
The bugbears captured a dog while they 
were up above. It’s Ironstone’s dog, which 
the heroes recognize. The friendly mutt 
hates the bugbears but affectionately follows 
the heroes around if they release it. 
Ironstone is especially grateful if they return 
the dog to him at the end of the adventure. 
The other bugbear has a folded sheet of 
parchment in its belt. If the heroes examine 
this sheet, they see a crude drawing of the 
town above. They’ve made a map of Haven! 


7. Xvarg Slaves 


This large chamber contains xvarg slaves 
and their bugbear overlords. The bugbears 


(SRE REE REE REI ROIL REI RELI REE RETR REE EE IRI ROT REI REI REE RE RETR REERE} 


are using the xvarg to help them dig tunnels 
up to Haven. They’ve already dug two (loca- 
tions “6” and “8”) and they’re working on 
two more (the spots marked “7”). 

When the heroes arrive, read: 


Two large creatures whip and yell at a 
dozen or so smaller creatures. The smaller 
humanoids are tied together with rope 
and are busy burrowing into the ceiling 
with crude picks and axes. “Work harder, 
you lazy snot heads!” one of the larger 
monsters shouts, cracking his great whip. 


The bugbears notice the 
heroes immediately and 
turn to attack. As in loca- 
tion “6,” the monsters 
make a lot of noise in an 
effort to alert the rest of the 
bugbear invaders. The 
bugbears fight to the 
death.

If the Heroes Free the Xvarg... 

... the grateful creatures pause for a 
moment to explain what they have learned. 
“The bugbears are preparing to invade the 
big people town overhead,” one xvarg 
informs them. “There aren’t too many here 
yet, but an army is supposed to arrive by 
nightfall. Then they’re going to climb up 
through these holes and murder the big peo- 
ple while they’re asleep.” 


8. Staging Area 

This is one of the main areas from which the 
bugbears plan to invade Haven. If the 
adventurers enter this area, read: 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 13 


ORR OR ~ On Par ee CORR POI ID ROP POO 27) 


A ladder leans against the far wall, while 
piles of junk fill the area beyond the blazing 
fire pit. Suddenly, a large creature bursts 
out of the shadows, swinging a mighty bat- 
tle ax at you and roaring in anger. 


This bugbear sentry guards the staging 
area. More concerned with threats from 
above, it nevertheless noticed the approach- ` 
ing heroes. 

Just like in location “6,” the noise this 
bugbear makes could attract a wandering 
monster (more bugbears). 

The ladder leads to the open field separat- 
ing the Temple of the Holy Defender and 
Kosi’s General Store. The junk includes 
crude spears (12 of them), flasks of oil (six), 
rope (three 50-foot coils), and two poorly 
crafted battle axes. 


9. The Main Battle 


Two bugbears and two skeletons guard this 
location. An ancient, withered bugbear 
shaman oversees the group and magically 
commands the skeletons. When the heroes 
approach the area, read the following aloud: 


Bedrolls surround a blazing fire pit. The 
far corner contains a mound of junk. A 
rough-hewn tunnel has been carved into 
the southern wall of the chamber. Two 
huge creatures stand around the fire, heft- 
ing large battle axes and staring at you 
with a mixture of terrible anger and 
extreme hunger. They roar and charge 
toward you.

Above the sound of battle, you hear the 
terrible sound of bone scraping on bone. 
Lunging out of the shadowy alcove at the 
back of the chamber, two stark-white 
skeletons move to join the battle with 
death-skull grins and rusty swords. 
Behind them, barely visible at the farthest 
edge of the firelight, stands an older, thin- 
ner bugbear, adorned in necklaces of 
bones and carved rocks. 


In the third round, the 
shaman joins the fight or 
decides to escape into the 
tunnel to warn the bug- 
bear king (who doesn’t 
appear in this adventure) 
that his plans have been 
foiled. He flees if the 
bugbears and skeletons 
are obviously losing.

What's in this Chamber? 
Here’s what's in this 
chamber (other than the 
bugbears). 

The bedrolls are crude 
and mangy. There isn’t 
anything to find inside 
them except dirt, hair balls, and various tiny 
insects. 

The junk includes food and drink for the 
invading army, extra spears, barrels of foul- 
tasting bugbear beer, and a small chest. The 
locked chest contains eight pieces of jewelry 
worth 25 gp each. The heroes can retrieve the 
jewelry if Niles picks the lock. If the chest is 
smashed open, a trap explodes that destroys 
the jewelry and inflicts 2d4 points of damage 
on anyone within 10 feet of the chest. 

The tunnel was dug by the bugbears to 
connect their underground lairs to the cham- 
bers beneath Haven. The bugbear king plans 
to send an army of bugbears into the town 
via the chambers, thus taking the town by 
surprise. If the heroes succeed, at the very 
least they can warn the townsfolk before the 
invaders arrive. 

If Niles or Thordar examine the tunnel, 
they notice that it is extremely unstable. The 
heroes can make Strength ability checks to 
disturb the construction and cause a cave-in. 
This effectively seals the tunnel and sets the 
bugbear king’s plan back many months. The 
heroes need a total of three successes (either 
by a single hero over the course of a few 


rounds or by some combination of heroes) 
to bring the tunnel walls down. 


Should You Roll for Wandering Monsters? 
No. If the heroes have gotten this far, there 
shouldn’t be any other bugbears to deal 
with. However, if they get to this location 
without visiting all of the other bugbear 
encounter sites (areas “6,” “7,” and “8”), five 
rounds after this battle begins any remain- 
ing bugbears from the other locations arrive 
to defend the tunnel. 


What’s Next? 

e If the heroes defeat the bugbears, skele- 
tons, and shaman, they can go warn the 
town and get their wounds healed. Award

Adventure #2: 
The Haunting of Black Isle 


The isolated island in the middle of the river 


was once a lush and beautiful location and 
the site of the original Temple of the Holy 
Defender. A terrible accident (whose nature 
remains a mystery) devastated the island 
many years ago. Now the place is over- 
grown and dark, and ruined buildings in 
various states of disrepair litter the island. 
This adventure begins as the heroes pre- 
pare to cross the covered bridge. Make sure 
that all of the characters have had a chance 
to heal since the events in UnderTown, to 
train (if they reached a new level), to pur- 


chase supplies and equipment, and to mem- 


orize their spells. 
Once all of that occurs, Kestin Pane calls 


the adventurers to his home. The read-aloud 
section below brings the players up to speed 


and sets them before the creepy bridge just 
hours before night again falls over the Vale. 


The map on the following page shows the 


layout of the island. Read the text below to 
start the action. 


Elder Pane implored you to assist him in a 
delicate and very personal matter. He 
claims that his sixteen-year-old daughter, 
the lovely Kira Pane, was kidnapped from 
her bedroom sometime before dawn. Her 
bedroom window was wide open when 
Pane went to wake her this morning. 

The elder first sent the town watch to 
search Haven for signs of his daughter. 
They found a swatch of her nightgown 
caught in the tangles growing around the 
covered bridge. 

“The town watch is under strict orders 
not to go to Black Isle,” the elder told you. 
“In fact, no one from Haven should set 
foot on that accursed place. However, my 


16 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS? Adventures Book 


CRE REEREER EE ROROREER ERE REE REE REE ROR ROE REE REE REO REI REAR REI} 


daughter is very, very important to me. I 
would only ask this of adventurers of 
your mettle. Will you brave the dangers of 
Black Isle and bring back my beloved Kira 
before the night comes again?” 

Now the covered bridge stretches over 
the river before you and the haunted 
island awaits you as the day begins to- 
wane. 


1. The Covered Bridge 
Before the heroes attempt to cross the bridge 
to reach Black Isle, read: 


The ancient bridge has suffered many years 
of neglect, but it appears tobe sturdy 
enough. A tangle of thick, thorny vines — 
grows over and around the bridge, cover- 
ing almost every surface. The entryway 
looks like a dark, cavernous maw. . 
Overhead, you see that the sun has passed 
the midpoint of the sky and has begun its 
descent toward night. 


The adventurers have about two hours 
before twilight falls upon the valley. Shortly 
thereafter, full darkness hits like a warham- 
mer, plunging the Vale into night. 

Find out the marching order of the party. 
Then ask the all-important question, “What 
do the heroes do?” 


Crossing the Bridge 

Despite its apparent condition, the bridge 
itself is actually quite safe to walk across. 
The trouble comes from what lives inside 
the bridge. 

The heroes must force their way through the 
tangle of thorny vines that coat the inner walls 
of the bridge and hang down from holes in the 
dilapidated roof. The adventurers can struggle 


SSS 


CRE LL LL LLL ERE ROR REI ROT RRO REE REE EORE REO REI RRO RO RETIREES 


through the dark interior of the bridge using 
what little sunlight filters in from each end 
and the not-quite-intact roof. Or they can uti- 
lize a light source and move through the shad- 
owy bridge with a bit more ease. 


Webs and Spiders 

Giant Spiders (3) About halfway across the 
bridge, they encounter 
unusually thick spider 

19 | Webs that stretch from ` 
roof to floor and between 
each wall. If they have a 
light source, the lead 
characters can attempt 
Wisdom checks to spot 
the webs before walking 
into them. If they aren’t

using a light source, the Wisdom check 
receives a +3 penalty. 

If the characters spot the webs, they can 
begin to cut or burn a path through them. If 
someone fails the Wisdom check and blun- 
ders into the webs, the character must make 
a successful Strength check to break free. 

Whether a hero is caught in the webs or 
the characters clear away the webs, the 
giant spiders that spun them rush to 
attack. There are three spiders in all. The 
spiders get to attack first in the initial 
round of combat. The first attacks the char- 
acter closest to (or caught in) the webs. It 
automatically hits anyone stuck in the 
webs; just roll for damage. The other two 
drop from the ceiling and strike at two 
other characters randomly.

2. The Island Forest 


Dark, thorny plants and moss-covered trees 
grow in a thick tangle across the island. The 
canopy overhead diffuses the sunlight, mak- 
ing the island floor shadowy and darker than 
daylight has any right to be. 

When the adventurers exit the bridge, read: 


The island seems even more overgrown 


and wild than you were led to believe. 
The forest around you is eerily silent, and 
the tight cover of leaves and branches 
overhead reduces the amount of sunlight 
reaching the forest floor. It’s dark, quiet, 
and slightly unnerving. 


If the characters want to examine the area 
before heading deeper into the island, have 
everyone make a Wisdom check. Any 
adventurers who succeed spot another strip 
of cloth from Kira’s sleeping gown. This one 
is snagged on a skeletal branch beside a 
path leading toward the island’s interior. 


Wandering Monsters 

Black Isle is home to a variety of creatures 
that the heroes might consider to be mon- 
sters. Every 10 rounds they spend in the 
western forest (area 2), check for wandering 
monsters. 

If the check indicates a monster is present, 
use one of these creatures (roll 1d8): 1-3, 
giant bats; 4-5, giant rats; 6-7, stirges; 8, 
zombies. 


3. The Cliff 
If the heroes wander toward this location, 
read: 


The wind blows through this clearing 
with amazing force. Here, the forest gives 


18 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 


way to an overgrown hill occupied by the 
ruins of an ancient tower. Beyond the 
tower, a rocky outcropping overlooks the 
dark waters of the Gryphon River. 


The cliff drops some thirty feet or so into 
the river. The rock wall is smooth and 
straight, making climbing difficult. If anyone 
falls from here to the rocks below (if Niles 
tries to climb down and slips, for example), 
the damage might be fatal (3d6+6). 

If the characters spend a moment to exam- 
ine the cliff or gaze out into the river, the 
ghost of a young woman appears. She is 
more an echo of the past than a supernatural 
menace; she doesn’t fight the heroes and 
really doesn’t interact with them. She simply 
haunts this spot. Read: 


The constant wind changes tone, becom- 
ing the awful wail of a crying girl. The ter- 
ribly sad sound surrounds you, coming 
from every direction at once. Then, 
appearing out of thin air just a few feet 
from the edge of the cliff, you see a forlorn 
young woman with dark hair and a white 
dress. She looks at you with eyes of dark 
water and the wail intensifies. Her feet 
don’t actually touch the ground. She 
seems to float a few inches above it and 
her body is translucent. She turns, steps 
off the cliff, and disappears. 


The characters can’t interact with this 
ghost in any way, but they can describe their 
reactions to seeing a ghost as part of the 
storytelling. She appears once and then 
leaves them to their quest, though her wail 
can sometimes be heard in the forest breezes 
while they remain on Black Isle.

4. Ruined Tower 


Rising from a hill on the far side of the 
island, this ruined tower overlooks the 
cliff and the river below. The upper level 
has partially collapsed, exposing the inte- 
rior to the elements. 


The tower has three levels. If the heroes 
decide to explore the tower, refer to the ` 
details below. 


Ground Level 

The door to the tower is locked. It’s sturdy (it 
cannot be battered down); only Niles (with a 
successful lockpick action) or Thaddeus (with 
his knock spell) can open it. The ground floor 
is dark, dusty, and empty. A staircase leads up 
to the second floor. 


Second Floor 
Gray Ooze 


This floor of the tower 
has no windows and is 
extremely dark. There is 
junk piled everywhere, 
Actions: 1 | and a staircase leads up 
Damage:  2d8 | to the third floor. 

XP: 270 | If the heroes take time to

floor above. They can’t 
take the rest of the loot 


some spells 


until after they destroy 
the creature guarding 
this level—a gray ooze. The gray ooze slides 
across the floor like a living puddle, seeking 
to consume any metal the heroes have with 
them. 

The loot consists of three sacks containing 
50 gp, 110 gp, and 35 gp respectively. There 
are also three magical arrows +1, though the 
heroes can’t learn about the enchantment 
just by looking at them. 


Third Floor 

A hole in the ceiling lets sunlight fall on a 
patch about one-quarter the size of this level 
of the tower. Two coffins sit in the shadows, 
just out of reach of the fading sun. When the 
heroes climb the stairs to this floor, the muf- 
fled banging grows louder and they can also 
hear the muffled shouts of a frightened 
young woman. 

Both coffins are locked. The best way to 
open them is to have Niles pick the locks or 
Thaddeus use his knock spell. The locks can 
also be smashed, though this shatters the 
coffins and could inflict harm upon the young 
woman imprisoned in one of the coffins. 

The first coffin is empty, though it con- 
tains a thin layer of dirt spread carefully 
over the padded lining. The second coffin 
contains Kira Pane. She is obviously fright- 
ened and her sleeping gown is dirty and 
torn, but she is otherwise unhurt. Once the 
heroes determine that she is unhurt (and 
indeed still alive!), they can calm her down 
and ask questions. 


“He came into my room while I was 
sleeping,” young Kira explains. “He told 
me that if I screamed, he would kill my 
whole family and still take me away. He 
stuck me in here and said he’d be back at 
sundown. Please take me home now.” 


If the heroes decide to leave the island 
immediately to return Kira to her family, the 
monster who stole her returns to capture her 
once more when night falls. They are better off 
keeping the young woman with them and 
rushing to locate and destroy the monster 
while sunlight remains in the valley. Kira 
protests, but she stays with the adventurers. 
She knows them and trusts them because of 
the aid they’ve already provided to Haven, 
plus she’s grown up with them. 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 19 


How Long Should the Day Last? 
The approaching night adds drama to this 
adventure. As the heroes explore the 
island and take time to battle monsters 
and gather treasure, remember to describe 
how the day is waning. Shadows grow 
longer, the sun drops lower in the sky, and 
the day gets cooler as each encounter 
ends. Don’t dwell on the time, but drop 
hints that the day is slowly running out. 
When should the sun finally disappear 
and full night take the island? This 
should occur when the heroes enter the 
cellar below area “8.” If you want to be 
really dramatic, wait until they find the 
secret room connected to area “8.” Just as 
the last rays of sunlight fade, the hidden 
coffin slides open with a rasping creak 
and Restad the lesser vampire emerges to 
confront our valiant heroes. 


5. The Zombie Patch 

Zombies (6) The clearing behind the 
ruined temple was the 
site of some horrible 
event in the past. Now, 
zombies await the 
approach of living beings 
so that they may rise up 
and rip them to shreds.

Soft dirt and a carpet of twisted weeds 
stretch out behind the ruins of the old tem- 
ple. A wail of utter despair and sorrow 
intermingles with the rush of wind blow- 
ing through the trees overhead, and the 


20 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 


ground ahead of you explodes with sudden 
activity. Hands burst forth from the ground, 
twisted like claws and covered in soil and 
black beetles. Then arms, heads, and within 
moments, bodies that look more dead than 
alive—despite the fact that they are mov- 
ing—rise up out of the soft dirt. Empty eye 
sockets turn toward you, and the decaying 
forms approach without hesitation. _ 


There are six zombies in all, the long-dead 
and partially decayed forms of the acolytes 
that once served the old temple. The rotting 
raiment that each zombie wears bears the 
symbol of the Holy Defender, but the good 
men these once were have become mindless 
monsters. Their only purpose is to destroy liv- 
ing beings who get too close to their graves.

A large crack opens this room to the forest 
outside. Junk fills the room. Every round the 
heroes search through the junk, roll for a 
wandering monster (as in area “2”) but suc- 
cess is indicated on a 1-4 on 1d20. 

Buried deep within the junk is a jeweled 
chest emblazoned with the symbol of the 
Holy Defender. It contains 300 gp. The chest 
itself is worth 100 gp.

8. Store Room 

The door to this room is locked. Inside, the

sounds of claws scraping across stone can be 
heard drifting up from below.

rats were just getting ready to tear through 
the sack and eat the mutt when the heroes 
arrived. 


There Is a Secret Door 

If the heroes search the cellar, they might 
find the secret door. If they don’t find it, 
they hear the creak of the opening coffin 
from behind the wall as the sun goes down. 
A moment later, the secret door slides open 
and Restad the lesser vampire steps out of

Adventure #3: 
To Find the Dragon's Lair 


A young red dragon lives in the mountains 
north of Haven. It sometimes snags cattle 
from the neighboring farms, and on 
extremely rare occasions it has been known 
to attack human settlements in the area. 
Until now, it has never made a foray into 
Haven itself. 

This adventure begins as the heroes head 
out in search of the dragon’s lair. Make sure 
that all of the characters have had a chance to 
heal since confronting Restad, to train (if they 
reached a new level), to purchase supplies 
and equipment, and to memorize their spells. 

Once all of that occurs, the heroes discov- 
er that something terrible happened while 
Haven slept. The read-aloud section below 
brings the players up to speed and gets the 
adventure off to a quick start. 

The map on the inside of the DM Screen 
shows the route from Haven to the dragon’s 
lair, while the map on the next page shows 
the layout of the lair itself. Read the text 
below to start the adventure. 


The town has a somber feel today. It 
seems that sometime during the night, the 
young red dragon that is sometimes seen 
flying out of the mountains to the north 
took the great holy symbol from the top of 
the temple. The symbol, emblazoned on a 
massive gold shield that once adorned the 
arch above the front door, is sacred to the 
entire community. 

“You must recover the holy symbol, my 
children,” the Patriarch beseeched you, “or 
a terrible curse will blacken the whole 
Vale.” 


With horses and a massive wagon in which 
to cart back the great shield, the heroes have 


SOIREE IAI ALOE 


departed Haven in search of the dragon’s lair. 
Two members of the town watch accompany 
them. They don’t go into the lair, but they do 
guard the horses and the wagon while the 
heroes ascend into the mountains. 

Use the map of the Vale (on the DM 
Screen) for encounters that take place en 
route to the dragon’s lair 


1. The Ruined Tower 


The first site of interest the adventurers 
reach is a ruined tower. Read: 


The trail passes through the rolling farm- 
land and into the forest. After a time, you 
come upon a small glade. Here, a squat 
stone tower rises from the side of a hill. 
Most of the tower lies in ruins, its upper 
levels shattered long ago. 

Just beyond the tower, you see a beauti- 
ful deer in the middle of the path. Four 
great wolves, called worgs by the locals, 
crouch to each side of the animal. It looks 
like they are about to pounce upon their 


prey. 


If the Heroes Ignore the Deer... 

... they can leave the path and stay clear of 
the bloody carnage to come. The sounds of 
the kill follow them for many minutes as 
they leave the area. Go on to encounter “2.” 


If the Heroes Assist the Deer... 
Worgs (4) ... roll for initiative. If 
the worgs go first, they 
AC: 6 | attack the deer and inflict 
hp: 21, 20, 

15,13 | massive damage. If the 
heroes go first and attack 
the worgs, the worgs 
turn on them instead. 

If the adventurers defeat 
the worgs, the deer 
demonstrates some amazing behavior. Read: 


THACO: 17 
Actions: 1 
Damage: 2d4 
XP: 120 each 


The deer turns to look at you, a somber 
intelligence filling its eyes. You notice that 
the symbol of the Holy Defender glows on 
the animal’s rear flank. It runs a few yards 
to the north, stops, looks back at you, then 
dashes along the path that follows along- 
side the river. 


The characters can follow the deer. It trav- 
els north along the path, leading them 
toward the dragon’s lair. It never allows 
them to catch it, but it maintains a modest 
distance. 


2. Ambush! 


As the adventurers travel on, they eventual- 
ly lose sight of the amazing deer. That’s 
when the ambush occurs. 


The sun grows warmer as the day pro- 
gresses. You travel on, the river to your 
right, the forest on your left. Suddenly, large 
shapes emerge from a thick cluster of trees. 
“Take their heads, boys, but leave their eyes 
for me!” growls the largest of the mon- 
sters—a huge bugbear armed with a 
double-bladed ax! 


There are eight bugbear 
raiders. Like all bug- 
bears, they attack first in 
the first round of combat. 
If the heroes defeat the 
bugbears and then search 
the area, they find a 
small wagon hidden 
among the trees. The 
wagon contains dead ani- 
mals (squirrels, rabbits, geese, etc.), 674 gp, a 
scroll case, and a large sack. 

The scroll case contains a rolled-up piece

“Tt swooped out of the sky, a red mon- 
ster that was all wings and fire. It belched 
a great stream of fire and smoke, igniting 
the wagon. Then it snatched our oxen in 
its claws and flew into the mountains.”

She points toward the mountains to the 
north, across the river. If the heroes look in 
that direction, they see the deer they helped 
earlier. It seems to confirm the path they 
must take, then runs ahead so they can 
follow. 


4. Fire in the Night 


The deer leads them to the foot of the moun- 
tain, revealing a path to the summit before it 
disappears into the brush. This is a good 
place for the heroes to make camp, resting 
and recovering spells before trekking to the 
dragon’s lair in the morning. 

During the night, roll twice for wandering 
monsters (Table M in the Rules Book). Before 
morning, read: 


A great roar from the sky above wakes 
you, and you can barely discern a large, 
dark shape gliding through the night sky. 
Another roar shatters the stillness of the 
night, and a fountain of fire erupts in the 
darkness overhead. In the glow of the fire- 
light, you see a red dragon. It flaps its 
powerful wings and disappears into the 
side of the mountaintop just as the last of 
the flames die away. 


There are no other events this evening. In 
the morning, the rested heroes enter the 
dragon’s lair. Use the map with the encoun- 
ters that follow. 


Climbing the Mountain 

Don’t spend a lot of time worrying about 
how the adventurers make it up the side of 
the mountain. When they break camp in the 
morning, the deer with the symbol of the 
Holy Defender on its side appears at the 
head of the path into the mountains. It waits 
for the adventurers to follow, then disap- 
pears around a bend. The town watchmen 
wait with the horses and wagon, and the 
heroes begin to climb. A few hours later, 
they reach the ledge that opens into loca- 
tions “1” and “2.” 


1. Stirges’ Cave 


A nest of stirges inhabits this cave. When the 
heroes enter, read: 


The opening in the side of the mountain 
leads into a chamber about 20 feet long 
and 30 feet wide, with a rocky floor and a 
smooth stone ceiling about 15 feet over- 
head. A passage near the rear of the cave 
leads deeper into the mountain. Before 
you take more than a few steps, some 
kind of birds or bats swoop from high 
ledges right toward you! 


The batlike, birdlike, buglike stirges 
swarm the character wearing the least 
amount of armor. There are eight of the 
blood-drinking creatures.

What's in this Chamber? 
Stirges (8) 


Just the eight stirges and 
their nests. If someone 
climbs up to check, one 
nest contains three eggs. 


Actions: Aljero pays 50 gp for 
Damage: 1d4-1 | each egg brought back to 
XP: 175each | Haven. 


Note: after a suc- 
cessful attack, 
drains 1d4 hp 
every round 


Should You Roll for 
Wandering Monsters? 
Yes. Check every round 
during the battle. If the 
check indicates a monster wanders by (to 
investigate the noise), use one of these crea- 
tures (roll 1d8): 1—4, orcs (1d4); 4-7, more 
stirges (2d4); 8, hobgoblin (1). 


2. Trapped Cave 


This square chamber seems empty on first 
inspection, but then you notice a large 
green gem hovering about five feet above 

-the ground at the very center of the cave. 


The green gem is suspended between 
crossed wires. If the heroes disturb the gem in 
any way, the cave floor right beneath it (center 
10 feet of the cave) swings open and drops 
anyone standing there into a 20-foot-deep pit 
(2d6 damage). The gem is worth 75 gp. 

If the heroes walk through the chamber, 
they disturb the crossed wires. When this 
happens, darts explode from all the walls, 
filling the cave with flying death. Everyone 
in the cave suffers 4d4 points of damage; a 
successful saving throw reduces this to half 
damage (2d4). 

If Niles successfully checks, he can spot 
the traps and attempt to disarm them before 
anyone crosses the chamber. Also, the wires 
can be crawled under or jumped over 
instead (Wisdom check +6 to spot). 


26 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 


The orcs that serve 
Moltenclaw the Dragon 
live in these connected 
chambers. There are 60 
orcs in all; 28 males, 20 
1d6 | females, and 12 children. 
Seach | The children do not fight. 
The orcs may be encoun- 
tered as wandering monsters (see encounter 
1), or the heroes might simply walk into 
their den. Some orcs attack; others run to 
warn the hobgoblin boss or the dragon. 

If the heroes want, they can try to sneak 
past the orc den and into the chambers 
beyond. This requires successful Dexterity 
checks (or Move Silently for Niles). If any- 
one fails, the orcs get a chance to hear them 
(1-2 on 1d10). If the heroes are spotted, the 
orcs attack as described above. 


5. Hoard Chamber 


This large cave has a 30-foot-high ceiling. 
Part of the dragon’s treasure hoard is stored 
here. When the heroes arrive, read: 


The wall on the far side of this large cav- 
ern opens to the sky and mountaintops 
beyond. A large section of the western half 
of the chamber contains a mound of treas- 
ure—gold, jewels, weapons, armor, and 
other beautiful and expensive items. A 
large humanoid stands atop the treasure, ~ 
examining various items and occasionally 
dropping something into its pockets. 


The hobgoblin is one of 
six who oversee the 
work of the orcs and 
help guard the dragon’s 
lair. This one likes to 
skim off the top, as it 
were, but she charges to

kill the heroes the moment she spots them. 
Every round during the battle, check for 
wandering monsters as described in loca- 


tion 1. 


6. Gelatinous Cave 


Gelantinous 


Cube 


AC: 8 
hp: 21 
THACO: 17 
Actions: 1 
Damage: special 


XP: 650 


Note: successful 
attack causes para- 
lyzation; paralyzed 
target is absorbed 
and suffers 2d4 
damage per round 


7. Hobgoblin Lair 


A gelatinous cube wan- 
ders the lair, cleaning up 
after the orcs and hob- 
goblins. The cube is in 
this cave when the 
heroes reach it. It attacks 
the moment they start to 
explore the cave. 

If the heroes kill the 
cube, they can extract the 
treasure it has absorbed: 
80 gp, a dagger, a long 
sword, and a gem worth 
500 gp. 


The other five hobgoblins use this large 
cave as a lair. If they haven’t encountered 
the heroes yet, they are here when the 
heroes arrive. Use the statistics from loca- 


tion 5. 


The hobgoblins have a total of 312 gp 
between them. One has a potion of healing in 
a belt pouch. Another has a long sword +1 
and uses it when he fights (1d8+1 damage). 


8. Dragon Food 


This fenced off cavern contains a variety of 
large animals that the dragon uses as food. 
There are six cows, two oxen, four horses, 
three deer, and six sheep currently on 


hand. 
9. Stirge Nests 


This chamber has the same inhabitants as 
location 1, except there are 12 in this cave 
instead of eight. See cave “1” for details. 


Stealing from the Dragon's Hoard 

There’s too much treasure for the heroes to 
cart it all away, but they can fill up if they 
choose. Each character can carry treasure 
worth his Strength score multiplied by 100 
gp. So, Elanna can carry 1500 gp (in addi- 


tion to anything else she finds in the lair). 

If the heroes want to search for special 
treasure, they can each make a single check 
at each hoard area. If the check succeeds, 
let the character roll on Table S and follow 
the instructions printed there to see what 
kind of magical item he or she found. 


10. Moltenclaw the Dragon 


This large, 30-foot-high chamber contains 
part of Moltenclaw’s hoard. 


A great opening looks out upon the sky. 
and the valley below. A huge pile of treas- 
ure fills much of the chamber, and you 
can see the temple shield among it. Lying 
atop the glistening mound is a red drag- 
on, its eyes closed, snoring softly. 


There are two ways for the heroes to 
approach this encounter—by sneaking or by 
fighting. Moltenclaw won't negotiate with 
the adventurers, and he’s quite fond of his 
new treasure (the symbol of the Holy 
Defender from atop Haven’s temple). 

Two characters with a total Strength of 25 
or better are required to heft the stolen 
shield. The players may come up with other 
clever ways to move it, including using 
Thaddeus’ levitate spell. 

Remember, the goal here isn’t necessarily 
to kill the dragon. If the heroes escape with 
the shield, they’ve succeeded. Of course, the 
dragon may return to Haven at some point, 
but that’s a tale for another adventure. 


DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® Adventures Book 27 


Sneaking 
Niles is best equipped to quietly cross the 
chamber and grab the huge shield. 

Unfortunately, it’s too heavy for him to lift 
on his own. If someone accompanies him, 
his chance to move silently receives a -3 
penalty to the roll. Niles must make two 
successful checks to reach the shield and 
four to carry it back. Any failure indicates 
that the dragon hears movement and wakes 
up. Go to “fighting,” below. 

If Niles is also invisible (thanks to a spell 
or potion), even if he fails a move silently 
check, the dragon may not notice him. Roll 
1d10. On a 1-3, the dragon becomes aware 
of the thief’s presence. 


Fighting 
Moltenclaw 
AC: 


Moltenclaw is tough. If 
the characters decide to 


hp: attack from a distance, 
THACO: 
Actions: 
Damage: 1d8+1/ 
1d8+1/ 


they act first. Otherwise, 
roll for initiative normal- 
ly. Moltenclaw uses his 
flame breath until the 
heroes get close. 
If Moltenclaw is reduced 
to 10 or fewer hit points, 
he roars defiantly and 
flies out of the cave. 
Remember, everyone gets 
to attack once more as he 
flees. If the dragon gets 
away, he goes off to heal. Eventually (in 
another adventure the DM makes up) he can 
return to seek his revenge on the heroes. 
Once combat starts, any orcs or hobgob- 
lins still in the lair rush to join the fight. 
They arrive by the third round of combat. 


2d8+1 
XP: 5,000 


Note: instead of 
attacking, can 
breathe fire for 
2d10+1 damage 
(save for half)

Fire Resistance: Works the 
same as the 2nd-level priest 
spell resist fire.

adins get a Strength score of

Scrolls 

Scrolls come in fancy tubes 
called scroll cases, and most 
have wizard or priest spells 
on them. Only wizards can 
read wizard scrolls, and only 
priests can read priest scrolls. 
Wizards must cast read magic 
to identify spells on a wizard 
scroll (wizards who cast read 
magic on a priest scroll know 
immediately that the spells 
are priest spells). Priests can 
identify spells on a priest 
scroll just by glancing 
through it. Once identified, 
spells can be cast at any time 
from a scroll by reading them. 
Once the spell is cast from the 
scroll, it is gone forever. 


Roll 1d6 for each spell on a 
scroll to see what level it is 
(1-3 = 1st level, 4-5 = 2nd 
level, 6 = 3rd level). Then roll

Rings 

Rings must be worn on fingers 
to activate their powers. A 
character may wear only one 
magical ring on each hand. 


Feather Falling: The wearer 
never suffers damage from 
falling, floating gently to the 
ground. 


Fire Resistance: Works the 
same as the 2nd-level priest 
spell resist fire, except it lasts 
as long as the ring is worn. 


Invisibility: Works the same 

as the 2nd-level wizard spell 

invisibility, except the wearer 

can become invisible and vis- 
ible any time he wants. 


Protection +1: The wearer 
gains a +1 bonus to all saving 
throws and reduces 
(improves) Armor Class by 1. 


Protecton +2: The same as 
protection +1 but better. 


Clumsiness: This ring has the 
power of another type of ring 
as well (roll again to see 
which one). Entering combat 
activates the ring’s curse and 
cuts the user’s Dexterity score 
in half. Thieves’ skills are cut 
in half, and spellcasters can 
cast spells only by making a 
successful saving throw first. 
Only a dispel magic spell 
allows the wearer to take the 
ring off, and then it becomes a 
normal, nonmagical ring 
forever. 


Staves and Wands 


A staff is a thick, wooden 
stick about 5 or 6 feet long. A 
wand is a thin, wooden stick 
about 1 foot long. Any staff 
or wand has 1d20+5 charges 
when it is first found. Using 
the staff or wand costs a 
charge unless noted. 


Wand of Fear: Works the 
same as the 1st-level priest 
spell cause fear. 


Wand of Fire: Creates a ball 
of fire that fills a 30’-diameter 
circle and inflicts 6d6 points 
of damage to all creatures in 
the circle. Creatures that roll 
a saving throw suffer half 
damage. Each fireball uses 2 
charges. Only wizards can 
use this wand. 


Wand of Illumination: Works 
the same as the 1st-level 
priest or wizard spell light. 


Wand of Lightning: Works 
the same as the 3rd-level wiz- 
ard spell lightning bolt, except 
it uses 2 charges. 


Staff of Curing: Works the 
same as the Ist-level priest 
spell cure light wounds. Only 
priests can use this staff. 


Wand of Magic Missles: 
Works the same as the 1st- 
level wizard spell magic 
missile. 


Miscellaneous Magic 


Boots of Elvenkind: The 
wearer’s feet never make any 
sounds when worn. 


Bracers of Defenselessness: 
These seem to give the wearer 
a +2 bonus to his Armor Class 
until he enters combat. During 
combat, the bracers’ curse 
changes the wearer’s Armor 
Class to 10. All shields, spells, 
or magic that improve Armor 
Class are ignored. Only a 
remove curse spell (from the 
Patriarch) will let the character 
take the bracers off. 


Cloak of Elvenkind: The 
wearer is completely invisible 
when he is in the forest or 
outdoors. In other dark 
places he still has a 9-in-10 
chance of not being seen. 
Even in brightly lit places, he 
only has a 5-in-10 chance of 
being seen. 


Dust of Appearance: One 
pinch of this dust cancels 
invisibility spells or any other 
spell or magical item that 
hides the true location of an 
object or creature. A pouch 
contains three pinches of the 
dust. 


Gauntlets of Ogre Strength: 
These metal gauntlets look 
like normal armor, but they 
give the wearer a +3 attack 
bonus and a +6 damage 
bonus. The wearer can also 
lift 500 pounds or carry up to 
330 pounds. 


Dungeons & Dragons Adventures Book 31 


Sao 


Portable Hole: This is a circle 
of black cloth 6 feet across. 
When spread over a solid sur- 
face, it makes a magical hole 
that is larger on the inside 
than the outside. Anything 
put into the hole stays there 
until it is spread out again. 
The hole can be folded to fit 
into a pocket. 


Rope of Climbing: This rope 
is 60 feet long and can hold 
up to 3,000 pounds safely. 
The user can command the 
rope to move in any direction 
and to tie and untie itself. It 
cannot be used to attack a 
creature. 


Rope of Constriction: This 
looks like a rope of climbing, 
but when the user commands 
it to act, the rope loops 
around the neck of the user 
and up to 1d4 creatures with- 
in 10 feet. Any creature that 
fails a saving throw is stran- 
gled for 2d6 damage each 
round until dead, the rope is 
hacked to pieces, or until a 
dispel magic spell is cast on 
the rope, which turns it into 
nonmagical rope forever. 


Stone of Good Luck: This 
looks like a cheap gemstone, 
but the owner gets a +1 
bonus to all die rolls (except 
attack and damage rolls) and 
all saving throws. 


Chime of Opening: This is a 
short, hollow metal tube. 
When pointed at a closed door, 
lid, chest, or lock and struck, 


the chime emits a clear musical 
note that opens the closed 
object immediately. 


Pearl of Wisdom: This 
appears to be a normal pearl, 
but it increases a priests’ 
Wisdom score by 1 point. 


Magical Armor 


Every piece of magical armor 
improves the wearer’s Armor 
Class by 1 for each “+” of 
magic. Cursed armor reduces 
the wearer’s AC by 1 and 
cannot be removed without a 
remove curse spell. 


Magical Weapons 

For each “+” of magic, the 
wielder adds that bonus to 
both attack and damage rolls 
when using the weapon. For 
cursed weapons, the wielder 
suffers a -1 penalty to attack 
and damage rolls and cannot 
use any other weapon until a 
remove curse spell is cast. 


Artifacts 


Artifacts are very rare magi- 
cal items that are usually 
very hard to find. 


Ax of Hurling: This is an ax 
+1 that, when thrown, auto- 
matically returns to the user 
right away, whether it hits 
anything or not. When it is 
thrown, it inflicts 2d6+1 dam- 
age; otherwise it inflicts 
1d6+1 damage. 


Mace of Distruption: This is 
a mace +1 with an extra 


32 Dungeons & Dragons Adventures Book 


power against undead crea- 
tures. The mace instantly 
destroys any skeleton, zom- 
bie, ghoul, shadow, or wight 
that it hits. 


Cursed Sword of Berserking: 
This seems to be a long sword 
+2 until the user enters com- 
bat. When the user gets into a 
fight, he goes berserk and 
automatically attacks the 
nearest creature to him, even 
his friends. He keeps attack- 
ing until there is nothing left 
to fight within 60 feet of him. 
The owner can only get rid of 
the sword with a remove curse 
spell and can’t use any other 
weapon in combat. 


Short Sword of Quickness: 
This is a short sword +2 that 

allows the user to make two 
attacks with it every combat 
round, instead of one. 


Sword +1, Flame Tongue: 
The user can turn the sword’s 
flames on and off. When on, 
the flames surround the 
blade and can set fire to any- 
thing that burns easily (such 
as paper, wood, or webs). 


Sword +1, Luck Blade: In 
addition to its combat bonus, 
this sword gives the user a +1 
bonus to all saving throws. 


Darkblade: Human Fighter 


sword. 


This great warrior stands strong and brave against 
the dangers of the world. His companions depend 

on him when combat begins, for his vast knowledge 
of weapons and tactics make him more than a match

wields large weapons such as a long bow and long

underground or wilderness place that most of 
the population of the Vale has never visited. It is 
important to make certain the party is well-

on the backs of the warriors’ sheets to round out 
the supplies), but it is equally important to keep 
track of where the group is going, and where 


they have been. 


In the underground setting, plenty of light 
sources, poles for probing, rope, spikes, and other 


mounts such as horses, a pack mule or two, extra 
arrows, food, and so forth are necessary for 
success.

Ability Scores 


The six basic traits of a character: 

° Strength shows how physically strong a character is 

© Dexterity shows a character’s physical quickness , 

e Constitution is a character’s physical toughness and 
endurance 

® Intelligence determines how smart a character is 

e Wisdom is a measure of a character’s common sense 

© Charisma shows how appealing a character is 


Ability Checks 


When a character wants to attempt a physical or mental 
feat not covered by other rules, use an ability check. 


To Roll an Ability Check: 

© Roll 1d20 

e Compare the result to the appropriate ability score 

If the die roll is lower than the score, the check succeeds 


Examples of Ability Checks 

Strength—pushing a large object 

Dexterity—leaping over a pit 
Constitution—overcoming the effects of spoiled food 
Intelligence—recalling an old legend 
Wisdom—spotting an obscure clue 
Charisma—negotiating with a monster 


Ability Check Modifiers

Turning Undead 


Priests have the ability to turn undead creatures. This 
means that they can force monsters like skeletons and 
zombies to flee from them when they present their holy 
_ symbol in a confident manner. 


Priest’s Level 
Monster 1st 2nd 3rd 
Skeleton 10 74 4 
Zombie 13 10 7 
Ghoul 16 13 10 
Shadow 19 16 13 
Lesser Vampire 20 19 16 


To Check a Turning Attempt: 

® Roll 1d20 

e Check the chart, comparing the priest’s level with the 
type of monster to be turned 

° If the die roll is higher than the number shown, the 
priest succeeds and 2d4 monsters of the specified type 
flee 

e A”T” result means the priest succeeds automatically 


DM Laws 


The DM decides what happens, using the actions the 
players declare for their characters, the game rules, 
and the DM’s imagination 

If in doubt, just make it up; it’s better to keep the story 
moving and the game fun than to get bogged down in 
the details 

Use ability checks to determine success if the players 


want their characters to try things not covered by any 
other rules; if an action is just impessibly difficult or 
ridiculously easy, the DM can decide that it automati- 
cally fails or succeeds 

Remember that the DM isn’t competing against the 
players; instead, the DM is like a referee, helping to 
advance the story by deciding how the players’ actions 
influence each situation 

Above all else, the DM must always be fair 


Searching 


Searching is a Wisdom check, modified by situation or 
character special abilities (see ability check) 
è It takes a character 10 rounds to search a 10’x10’ area 


è It can’t be done in the middle of combat or with hostile 


creatures around 
Each character can search an area once 
Make the check even if there is nothing to find 


e 
Resting 
Characters that gain a full night’s rest reduce wounds 
by 1 hit point 


Spellcasters regain their full compliment of spell 


Thief Skills 


Pick Pockets: Allows the thief to slip something from a pocket 
or backpack without the owner knowing. 

Open Locks: Allows the thief to pick a lock using his thief tools. 
Find/Remove Traps: Allows the thief to find traps on doors, in 
halls, etc. Once found, he can attempt to disarm the trap. 

Move Silently: The thief can move 40 feet per round while 
attempting to be very quiet. 

Hide in Shadows: The thief can attempt to slip into the dark- 
ness to hide. If he moves or attacks, he is no longer hidden. 
Detect Noise: The thief can try to hear sounds the other characters 
can’t, such as shallow breathing or a boot scraping on a floor tile. 
Climb Walls: The thief can attempt to climb a wall without the 
use of a rope. If successful, he climbs 20 feet every round. Check 
every round for success. 

Backstab: The thief gains a +4 bonus to the attack roll when he 
is behind an opponent that does not know he is there. If the 
backstab succeeds, double the amount of damage rolled. 


To Check A Thief Skill Attempt: 

Secretly Roll 1d20 

® Subtract any bonuses from or add any penalties to the 
result 

e Compare that result to the skill number 

è If the result is equal to or lower than the skill number, 
the thief succeeds

that has already started, any qpponepte fighting the mon- 


ster or character get to make a final attack

round 
At the end of the spellcaster’s half of the round, spells go 
off in the order in which they were cast and the effects 
take place 
Once a spell is cast, the player marks it off; it can’t be 
used again until the hero rests and re-memorizes it 
If the spellcaster is successfully attacked before he gets to 
act in a round, he can’t cast a spell that round
